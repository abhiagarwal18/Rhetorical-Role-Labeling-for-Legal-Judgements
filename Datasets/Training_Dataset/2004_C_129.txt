Estoppel is a rule of equity which has gained new dismensions in recent years	Facts
A new class of estoppel has come to be recognized by the courts in this country as well as in England	Facts
The doctrine of 'promissory estoppel' has assumed importance in recent years though it was dimly noticed in some of the earlier cases	Facts
The leading case on the subject is Central London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd., [1947] 1 K.B. 130	Precedent
The rule laid down in High Trees case (supra), again came up for consideration before the King's Bench in Combe v. Bombe, [1951] 2 K.B. 215	Precedent
Therein the court ruled that the principle stated in High Trees's case (supra), is that, where one party has, by his words or conduct, made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly, then, once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it, the party who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal relationship as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him, but he must accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he himself has so introduced, even though it is not supported in point of law by any consideration, but only by his word	Precedent
But that principle does not create any cause of action, which did not exist before; so that, where a promise is made which is not supported by any consideration, the promise cannot bring an action on the basis of that promise	Precedent
The principle enunciated in the High Trees case (supra), was also recognized by the House of Lords in Tool Metal Manufacturing Co. Ltd	Precedent
v. Tungsten Electric Co. Ltd., [1955	Precedent
All E.R. 657	Precedent
1955] 1 W.L.R. 761	Precedent
That principle was adopted by this Court in Union of India v. Indo-Afghan Agencies Ltd., AIR (1968	Precedent
SC 718 1967 Indlaw SC 411 and Turner Morrison and Co. Ltd. v. Hungerford Investment Trust Ltd., [1972] 1 SCC 857 1972 Indlaw SC 190	Precedent
Doctrine of "Promissory Estoppel" has been envolved by the courts, on the principles of equity, to avoid injustice	Precedent
Promissory Estoppel" is defined in Black's Law Distionary as "an estoppel which arises when there is a promise which promissor should reasonable expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of promisee, and which does include such action or forbearance, and such promise is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of promise	Precedent
So far as this Court is concerned, it invoked the doctrine in Indo Afghan Agencies's case 1967 Indlaw SC 411 (supra) in which is was, inter alia, laid down that even though the case would not fall within the terms of Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (in short the 'Evidence Act') which enacts the rule of estoppel, it would still be open to a party who had acted on a representation made by the Government to claim that the Government should be bound to carry out the promise made by it even though the promise was not recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by Article 299 of the Constitution	Precedent
See Century Spinning Co. v. Ulhasnagar Municipal Council, AIR (1971	Precedent
SC 1021 1970 Indlaw SC 341, Radhakrishna v. State of Bihar, AIR (1977	Precedent
SC 1496 1977 Indlaw SC 282, Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P., [1979] 2 SCC 409 1978 Indlaw SC 56, Union of India v. Godfrey Philips Indian Ltd., [1985] 4 SCC 369 1985 Indlaw SC 275 and Dr. Ashok Kumar Maheshwari v. State of U.P. & Another, (1998) 2 Supreme 100 1998 Indlaw SC 1376	Precedent
In the backdrop, let us travel a little distance into the past to understand the evolution of the doctrine of "promissory estoppel	Precedent
Dixon, J. an Australian Jurists, in Grundt v. Great Boulder Gold Mines Prorietary Ltd., [1939] 59 CLR 641 (Aust) laid down as under: "It is often said simply that the party asserting the estoppel must have been induced to act to his detriment	Precedent
Although substantially such a statement is correct and leads to no misunderstanding, it does not bring out clearly the basal purpose of the doctrine	Precedent
That purpose is to avoid or prevent a detriment to the party asserting the estoppel by compelling the opposite party to adhere to the assumption upon which the former acted or abstained from acting	Precedent
This means that the real detriment or harm from which the law seeks to give protection is that which would flow from the change of position if the assumptions were deserted that led to it	Precedent
The principle, set out above, was reiterated by Lord Denning in High Trees's case (supra	Precedent
This principle has been evolved by equity to avoid injustice	Precedent
It is nether in the realm of contract nor in the realm of estoppel	Precedent
Its object is to interpose equity shorn of its form to mitigate the rigour of strict law, as noted in Anglo Afghan Aencies's case1967 Indlaw SC 411 (supra) and Sharma Transport Represented by D.P. Sharma v. Government of A.P. and Others, [2002] 2 SCC 188 2001 Indlaw SC 19917	Precedent
No vested right as to tax holding is acquired by a person who is granted concession	Ratio of the decision
If any concession has been given it can be withdrawn at any time and no time limit should be insisted upon before it was withdrawn	Ratio of the decision
The rule of promissory estoppel can be invoked only if on the basis of representation made by the Government, the industry was established to avail benefit if of exemption	Ratio of the decision
In Kasinka Trading and Anr	Precedent
v. Union of India and Anr	Precedent
1995] 1 SCC 274 1994 Indlaw SC 2183	Precedent
it was held that the doctrine of promissory estoppel represents a principle evolved by equity to avoid injustice	Precedent
A person may have a 'legitimate expectation' of being treated in a certain way by an administrative authority even though he has no legal right in private law to receive such treatment	Ratio of the decision
The expectation may arise either from a representation or promise made by the authority, including an implied representation, or from consistent past practice	Ratio of the decision
The doctrine of legitimate expectation has an important place in the developing law of judicial review	Ratio of the decision
It is, however, not necessary to explore the doctrine in this case, it is enough merely to note that a legitimate expectation can provide a sufficient interest to enable one who cannot point to the existence of a substantive right to obtain the leave of the court to apply for judicial review	Ratio of the decision
It is generally agreed that 'legitimate expectation' gives the applicant sufficient locus standi for judicial review and that the doctrine of legitimate expectation to be confined mostly to right to a fair hearing before a decision which results in negativing a promise or withdrawing an undertaking is taken	Ratio of the decision
The doctrine does not give scope to claim relief straightway from the administrative authorities as no crystallized right as such involved	Ratio of the decision
The protection of such legitimate expectation does not require the fulfilment of the expectation where an overriding public interest requires otherwise	Ratio of the decision
In other words, where a person's legitimate expectation in not fulfilled by taking a particular decision then decision maker should justify the denial of such expectation by showing some overriding public interest	Ratio of the decision
See Union of India and Others	Ratio of the decision
v. Hindustan Development Corporation and Others, AIR (1994	Ratio of the decision
SC 9981993 Indlaw SC 1085	Ratio of the decision
While the discretion to change the policy in exercise of the executive power, when not trammelled by any statute or rule is wide enough, what is imperative and implicit in terms of Article 14 is that a change in policy must be made fairly and should not give impression that it was so done arbitrarily or by any ulterior criteria	Ratio of the decision
The wide sweep of Article 14 and the requirement of every State action qualifying for its validity on this touchstone irrespective of the field of activity of the State is an accepted tenet	Ratio of the decision
The basic requirement of Article 14 is fairness in action by the State, and non-arbitrariness in essence and substance is the heart beat of fair play	Ratio of the decision
Actions are amenable, in the panorama of judicial review only to the extent that the State must act validity for discernible reasons, not whimsically for any ulterior purpose	Ratio of the decision
The meaning and true import and concept of arbitrariness is more easily visualized than precisely defined	Ratio of the decision
A question whether the impugned action is arbitrary or not is to be ultimately answered on the facts and circumstances of a given case	Ratio of the decision
A basic and obvious test to apply in such cases is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned action and if so, does if really satisfy the test of reasonableness	Ratio of the decision
Where a particular mode is prescribed for doing an act and there is no impediment in adopting the procedure, the deviation to act in different manner which does not disclose any discernible principle which is reasonable itself small be labelled as arbitrary	Ratio of the decision
Every State action must be informed by reason and it follows that an act uninformed by reason is per se arbitrary	Ratio of the decision
This Court's observations in G. B. Mahajan v. Jalgaon Municipal Council, AIR (1991) SC 1153 1990 Indlaw SC 438 are kept out of lush field of administrative policy except where policy is inconsistent with the express or implied provision of a statute which creates the power to which the policy relates or where a decision made in purported exercise of power is such that a repository of the power acting reasonably and in good faith could not have made it	Ratio of the decision
But there has to be a word of caution	Ratio of the decision
Something overwhelming must appear before the Court will intervene	Ratio of the decision
That is and ought to be a difficult onus for an applicant to discharge	Ratio of the decision
The Courts are not very good at formulating or evaluating policy	Ratio of the decision
Sometimes when the Courts have intervened on policy grounds the Court's view of the range of policies open under the statute or of what is unreasonable policy has not got public acceptance	Ratio of the decision
On the contrary, curial views of policy have been subjected to stringent criticism	Ratio of the decision
As Professor Wade points out (in Administrative Law by H.W.R. Wade, 6th Edition) there is ample room within the legal boundaries for radical differences of opinion in which neither side is unreasonable	Ratio of the decision
The reasonableness in administrative law must, therefore, distinguish between proper course and improper abuse of power	Ratio of the decision
Nor is the test Court's own standard of reasonableness as it might conceive it in a given situation	Ratio of the decision
The point to note is that the thing is not unreasonable in the legal sense merely because the Court thinks it to be unwise	Ratio of the decision
In Hindustan Development Corporation's case1993 Indlaw SC 1085 (supra), it was observed that decision taken by the authority must be found to be arbitrary, unreasonable and not taken in public interest where the doctrine of legitimate expectation can be applied	Ratio of the decision
If it is a question of policy, even by ways of change of old policy, the Courts cannot intervene with the decision	Ratio of the decision
In a given case whether there are such facts and circumstances giving rise to legitimate expectation, would primarily be a question of fact	Ratio of the decision
As was observed in Punjab Communications Ltd. v. Union of India of Others, AIR (1999) SC 1801 1999 Indlaw SC 1548, the change in policy can defeat a substantive legitimate expectation if it can be justified on "Wednesbury reasonableness	Precedent
The decision-maker has the choice in the balancing of the pros and cons relevant to the change in policy	Precedent
It is, therefore, clear that the choice of police is for the decision-maker and not the Court	Precedent
The legitimate substantive expectation merely permits the Court to find out if the change of policy which is the cause for defeating the legitimate expectation is irrational or perverse or one which no reasonable person could have made	Precedent
A claim based on merely legitimate expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right	Precedent
Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it covers the entire span of time; present, past and future	Precedent
How significant is the statement that today is tomorrows' yesterday	Precedent
The present is as we experience it, the past is a present memory and future is a present expectation	Ratio of the decision
For legal purposes, expectation is not same as anticipation	Ratio of the decision
Legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law	Ratio of the decision
As observed in Attorney General for New South wale v. Quinn, [1990] 64 Australian LJR 327 to strike the exercise of administrative power solely on the ground of avoiding the disappointment of the legitimate expectations of an individual would be to set the Courts adrift on a featureless sea of pragmatism	Ratio of the decision
Moreover, the negotiation of a legitimate expectation (falling short of a legal right) is too nebulous to form a basis for invalidating the exercise of a power when its exercise otherwise accords with law	Ratio of the decision
If a denial of legitimate expectation in a given case amounts to denial of right guaranteed or is arbitrary, discriminatory, unfair or biased, gross abuse of power of violation of principles of natural justice, the same can be questioned on the well known grounds attracting Article 14 but a claim based on mere legitimate expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles	Ratio of the decision
It can be one of the grounds to consider, but the Court must lift the veil and see whether the decision is violative of these principles warranting interference	Ratio of the decision
It depends very much on the facts and the recognised general principles of administrative law applicable to such facts and the concept of legitimate expectation which is the latest recruit to a long list of concepts fashioned by the Courts for the review of administrative action must be restricted to the general legal limitations applicable and binding the manner of the future exercise of administrative power in a particular case	Ratio of the decision
It follows that the concept of legitimate expectation is 'not the key which unlocks the treasure of natural justice and it ought not to unlock the gates which shuts the Court out of review on the merits,' particularly, when the elements of speculation and uncertainty are inherent in that very concept	Ratio of the decision
As cautioned in Attorney General for New South wale's case the Courts should restrain themselves and respect such claims duly to the legal limitations	Ratio of the decision
It is a well meant caution	Ratio of the decision
Otherwise, a resourceful litigant having vested interest in contract, licences, etc. can successfully indulge in getting welfare activities mandated by directing principles thwarted to further his own interest	Ratio of the decision
The caution, particularly in the changing scenario becomes all the more important	Ratio of the decision
If the State acts within the bounds of reasonableness, it would be legitimate to take into consideration the national priorities and adopt trade policies	Ratio of the decision
As noted above, the ultimate test is whether on the touchstone of reasonableness the policy decision comes out unscathed	Ratio of the decision
Reasonableness of restriction is to be determined in an objective manner and from the standpoint of interest of the general public and not from the standpoint of the interests of persons upon whom the restrictions have been imposed or upon abstract consideration	Ratio of the decision
A restriction cannot be said to be unreasonable merely because in a given case, it operates harshly	Ratio of the decision
In determining whether there is any unfairness involved the nature of the right alleged to have taken infringed, the underlying purpose of the restriction imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing condition at the relevant time enter into judicial verdict, the reasonableness of the legitimate expectation has to be determined with respect to the circumstances relating to the trade or business in question	Ratio of the decision
Canalisation of a particular business in favour of even a specified individual is reasonable where the interests of the country are concerned or where the business affects the economy of the country	Ratio of the decision

Article 166 of the Constitution deals with the conduct of Government business	Statute
The said provision reads as follows: "166	Statute
Conduct of business of the Government of a State,- (1) All executive action of the Government of a State shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the Governor	Statute
2) Orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of the Governor shall be authenticated in such manner as may be specified in rules to be made by the Governor, and the validity of an order or instrument which is so authenticated shall not be called in question on the ground that it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the Governor	Statute
The Governor shall make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the Government of the State, and for the allocating among Ministers of the said business in so far as it is not business with respect to which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to act in his discretion	Statute
Clause (1) requires that all executive action of the State Government shall have to be taken in the name of the Governor	Ratio of the decision
Further, is no particular formula of words required for compliance with Article 166(1	Ratio of the decision
What the Court has to see is whether the substance of its requirement has been complied with	Ratio of the decision
A Constitution Bench in R. Chitralekha Etc	Ratio of the decision
v. State of Mysore and Ors	Ratio of the decision
AIR (1964	Ratio of the decision
SC 1823 1964 Indlaw SC 103 held that the provisions of the Article were only directory and not mandatory in character and if they were not complied with it could still be established as a question of fact that the impugned order was issued in fact by the State Government or the Governor	Ratio of the decision
Clause (1) does not prescribe how an executive action of the Government is to be performed; it only prescribes the mode under which such act is to be expressed	Ratio of the decision
While clause (1) is in relation to the mode of expression, clause (2) lays down the ways in which the order is to be authenticated	Ratio of the decision
Whether there is any Government order in terms of Article 166; has to be adjudicated from the factual background of each case	Ratio of the decision
In order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel clear, sound and positive foundation must be laid in the petition itself by the party invoking and doctrine the bald expressions without any supporting material to the effect that the doctrine is attracted because the party invoking the doctrine has altered its position relying on the assurance of the Government would not be sufficient to press into aid the doctrine	Ratio of the decision
The Courts are bound to consider all aspects including the results sought to be achieved and the public good at large, because while considering the applicability of the doctrine, the Courts have to do equity and the fundamental principles of equity must for ever be present in the mind of the Court	Ratio of the decision
In Shrijee Sales Corporation and Anr	Precedent
v. Union of India, [1997] 3 SCC 398 1996 Indlaw SC 1561 it was observed that once public interest is accepted as the superior equity which can override individual equity the principle would be applicable even in cases where a period has been indicated for operation of the promise	Precedent
If there is a supervening public equity, the Government would be allowed to change its stand and has the power to withdraw from representation made by it which induced persons to take certain steps which may have gone adverse to the interest of such persons on account of such withdrawal	Precedent
Moreover, the Government is competent to rescind from the promise even if there is no manifest public interest involved, provided no one is put in any adverse situation which cannot be rectified	Precedent
Similar view was expressed in M/s	Precedent
Pawan Alloys and Casting Pvt. Ltd	Precedent

v. Shree Durga Oil Mills and Anr	Precedent
1999] 1 SCC 573 1997 Indlaw SC 1219, it was further held that the Government could change its industrial policy if the situation so warranted and merely because the resolution was announced for a particular period, it did not mean that the government could not amend and change the policy under any circumstances	Precedent
If the party claiming application of the doctrine acted on the basis of a notification it should have known that such notification was liable to be amended or rescinded at any point of time, if the government felt that it was necessary to do so in public interest	Precedent
In view of the factual position recorded by the High Court that at the point of time the appellants' units were set up and the commercial production started there was no assurance or promise	Ratio of the decision
The doctrine of promissory estoppel had no application to the facts of the case at that stage	Ratio of the decision
We find no substance in the plea that before a policy decision is taken to amend or alter the promise indicated in any particular notification, the beneficiary was to be granted an opportunity of hearing	Ratio of the decision
Such a plea is clearly unsustainable	Ratio of the decision
While taking policy decision, the government is not required to hear the persons who have been granted the benefit which is sought to be withdrawn	Ratio of the decision
The question of legitimate expectation arises according to the appellants after the benefits were granted by the concerned G.O.Ms	Ratio of the decision
At this juncture we would like to take note to certain factual positions highlighted by the appellants which are practically undisputed by the respondents	Ratio of the decision
Contrary to what the High Court has stated, it appears from record that counter affidavits were filed	Ratio of the decision
The reasons which have weighed with the High Court to uphold the action of the State were not pleaded before the High Court specifically, and the High Court cull out those from the files which were produced before it	Ratio of the decision
Though the appellants were not entitled to any opportunity of hearing before alteration of the benefits flowing from the notifications or withdrawal of any benefit, yet when the State has not taken any specific stand justifying the withdrawal and the High Court referred to the files to put its seal of proof, notwithstanding non-requirement for granting any opportunity before the withdrawal, principles of natural justice certainly were applicable, since the High Court with reference to the files recorded findings on the basis thereof	Ratio of the decision
As noted above no specific grounds or reasons were indicated to justify the withdrawal in the affidavits filed before the Tribunal or the High Court, as the case may be	Ratio of the decision
As the correctness of factual basis justifying withdrawal is in issue, fair play certainly warranted grant of opportunity to the appellants to present its side of the picture	Ratio of the decision
Further, a definite plea was taken that there was no scope for retrospective withdrawal of benefit by an executive order	Ratio of the decision
The High Court has not dealt with the issue	Ratio of the decision
The same also needs to be examined	Ratio of the decision
Above being the position, decision of the High Court by placing reliance on the files to hold that the withdrawal was justified, is not tenable in law and in the fitness of things, the High Court should hear the matter afresh and taken decision on those two issues	Ratio of the decision
It is made clear that we have not expressed any opinion on those issues on the facts of the present case	Ratio of the decision
It is to be noted that no privilege was claimed from production of the file as the files were produced before the High Court and in fact the High Court referred to the materials on the files to affirm State's action	Ratio of the decision
We direct that the State Government, if it so chooses, shall file its further counter-affidavits before the High Court within six weeks from today indicating the reasons which warranted the withdrawal of the benefits extended	Ratio of the decision
The plea of the appellants regarding legitimate expectation shall be considered by the High Court in the light of materials to be placed by the respondents by affidavits as directed above	Ratio of the decision
We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the factual aspects except indicating the principles underlying legitimate expectation	Ratio of the decision
Another point which was specifically raised before the High Court but has not been dealt by it is the legality of the action in directing retrospective withdrawal of the benefit by a letter of the Government	Ratio of the decision
Whether the same is permissible in law has to be decided by the High Court	Ratio of the decision
To the aforesaid limited extent, the matter is remitted to the High Court for fresh consideration	Ruling by Present Court
The appeals are disposed of accordingly without any order as to costs	Ruling by Present Court
