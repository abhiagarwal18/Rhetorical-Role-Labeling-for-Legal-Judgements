In Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.19375-19376 of 2005,the respondents were appointed on ad hoc basis for a period of six months	Facts
Their appointments were also cancelled on similar grounds	Facts
The respondents herein filed writ petitions before the High Court on 4.06.1998 questioning the said order of cancellation of their appointments	Ratio of the decision
The said Shri Tayeng retired on 28.02.1998.Despite the fact that he,in his UO Note dated 12.02.1998 addressed to the Minister of Revenue,denied to have made any appointment,when approached by the writ petitioners respondents,he affirmed in their support an affidavit in the High Court stating: "3.That,while I was functioning as Revenue Commissioner,Manipur,matters relating to appointment on the recommendation of the D.P.C.,transfer etc.were put-up to me in files and I used to pass order on the basis of facts presented to me in file	Facts
I also issued appointment order under my signature	Facts
After my retirement from service I have no access to such files	Facts
As stated above,I was transferred and posted to the Manipur Electronics Development Corporation during 1997	Facts
4.That after my retirement,some of the writ petitioners civil Rule No.568 of 1998,came to me and show copy of the writ petition and the counter affidavit of the respondent No.1,2 and 3.I have gone through the copy of the writ petition and the counter-affidavit and annexures thereto	Facts

I submit that these appointment orders (annexures A/1 and A/2) bear my signature (initial) and appear to have been issued under my signature	Facts
It appears that the appointment orders were issued after complying the formalities prescribed there for which can be ascertained from the relevant official file	Facts
Since I have retired from service,I have no access to the file and do not know what might have been in the file and where is the file	Facts
Verified that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and no part of it is false	Facts

ii	Ruling by Lower Court
Whereas,in the impugned order,the appointments of the respondents were said to have been passed without the knowledge of the Administrative Department (Revenue Department); in the counter affidavit,it was stated that no records were available in respect thereof and,thus,the said plea being inconsistent with each other,the orders of cancellation of appointment would be bad in law in the light of a decision of this Court in Mohinder Singh Gill and Anr.v	Ruling by Lower Court

So far as the matter relating to Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.19375-19376 of 2005 is concerned,it was directed that as the appointment of the respondents were made for a period of six months,the employees were only entitled to the salary for the said period	Ruling by Lower Court

It was argued that the question,as to whether appointments were made without the knowledge of the Department or for that matter whether any record was available there for was of not much significance as in effect and substance they lead to the same inference and in that view of the matter,the decision of this Court in Mohinder Singh Gill 1977 Indlaw SC 53 (supra) was not attracted	Argument
S.B.Sanyal,learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents,on the other hand,would submit that the question as to whether the appointments of the respondents were nullities or not having not been raised before the High Court,this Court should not permit the appellants to raise the said contention at this stage	Argument

The State while offering appointments,having regard to the constitutional scheme adumbrated in Arts.14 and 16 of the Constitution of India,must comply with its constitutional duty,subject to just and proper exceptions,to give an opportunity of being considered for appointment to all persons eligible there for	Ratio of the decision
The posts of field staffs of the Revenue Department of the State of Manipur were,thus,required to be filled up having regard to the said constitutional scheme	Ratio of the decision
We would proceed on the assumption that the State had not framed any recruitment rules in terms of the proviso appended to Art.309 of the Constitution of India but the same by itself would not clothe the Commissioner of Revenue to make recruitments in violation of the provisions contained in Arts.14 and 16 of the Constitution of India	Ratio of the decision
The offers of appointment issued in favour of the respondents herein were cancelled inter alia on the premise that the same had been done without the knowledge of the Revenue Department of the State	Ratio of the decision
No records there for were available with the State	Ratio of the decision
As noticed hereinbefore,an inquiry had been made wherein the said Shri Tayeng,the then Commissioner of Revenue stated that no such appointment had been made to his knowledge	Ratio of the decision
The State proceeded on the said basis	Ratio of the decision
The offers of appointment were cancelled not on the ground that some irregularities had been committed in the process of recruitment but on the ground that they had been non-est in the eye of law	Ratio of the decision
The purported appointment letters were fake ones	Ratio of the decision
They were not issued by any authority competent therefor	Ratio of the decision
If the offers of appointments issued in favour of the respondents herein were forged documents,the State could not have been compelled to pay salaries to them from the State exchequer	Ratio of the decision
Any action,which had not been taken by an authority competent therefor and in complete violation of the constitutional and legal framework,would not be binding on the State	Ratio of the decision
In any event,having regard to the fact that the said authority himself had denied to have issued a letter,there was no reason for the State not to act pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof	Ratio of the decision
The action of the State did not,thus,lack bonafide	Ratio of the decision
Moreover,it was for the respondents who had filed the writ petitions to prove existence of legal right in their favour	Ratio of the decision
They had inter alia prayed for issuance of a writ of or in the nature of mandamus	Ratio of the decision
It was,thus,for them to establish existence of a legal right in their favour and a corresponding legal duty in the respondents to continue to be employed	Ratio of the decision
With a view to establish their legal rights to enable the High Court to issue a writ of mandamus,the respondents were obligated to establish that the appointments had been made upon following the constitutional mandate adumbrated in Arts.14 and 16 of the Constitution of India	Ratio of the decision
They have not been able to show that any advertisement had been issued inviting applications from eligible candidates to fill up the said posts	Ratio of the decision
It has also not been shown that the vacancies had been notified to the employment exchange	Ratio of the decision
The Commissioner furthermore was not the appointing authority	Ratio of the decision
He was only a cadre controlling authority	Ratio of the decision
He was merely put a Chairman of the DPC for non-ministerial post of the Revenue Department	Ratio of the decision
The term "DPC" would ordinarily mean the Departmental Promotion Committee	Ratio of the decision
The respondents had not been validly appointed and in that view of the matter,the question of their case being considered for promotion and/ or recruitment by the DPC did not and could not arise	Ratio of the decision
Even assuming that DPC would mean Selection Committee,there is noting on record to show who were its members and how and at whose instance it was constituted	Ratio of the decision
The Commissioner,as noticed hereinbefore,was the Chairman of the DPC.How the matter was referred to the DPC has not been disclosed	Ratio of the decision
Even the affidavit affirmed by Shri Tayeng before the High Court in this behalf is silent	Ratio of the decision
The appointing authority,in absence of any delegation of power having been made in that behalf,was the State Government	Ratio of the decision
The Government Order dated 12.01.1998 did not delegate the power of appointment to the Commissioner	Ratio of the decision
He,therefore,was wholly incompetent to issue the appointment letters	Ratio of the decision
The respondents,therefore,in our opinion,were not entitled to hold the posts	Ratio of the decision
In a case of this nature,where the facts are admitted,the principles of natural justice were not required to be complied with,particularly when the same would result in futility	Ratio of the decision
It is true that where appointments had been made by a competent authority or at least some steps have been taken in that behalf,the principles of natural justice are required to be complied with,in view of the decision of this Court in Murugayya Udayar 1991 Indlaw SC 904 (supra	Ratio of the decision
We,as noticed hereinbefore,do not know as to under what circumstances the orders of appointments were issued	Ratio of the decision
The said decision is not an authority for the proposition that the principles of natural justice are required to be complied with in all situations	Ratio of the decision
In Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi 1990 Indlaw SC 463 (supra),this Court was dealing with a question in regard to continuance of the Law Officers	Precedent
The question which arose herein was not raised	Precedent
It was held: "34.In our opinion,the wide sweep of Art.14 undoubtedly takes within its fold the impugned circular issued by the State of U.P.in exercise of its executive power,irrespective of the precise nature of appointment of the Government Counsel in the districts and the other rights,contractual or statutory,which the appointees may have	Precedent
It is for this reason that we base our decision on the ground that independent of any statutory right,available to the appointees,and assuming for the purpose of this case that the rights flow only from the contract of appointment,the impugned circular,issued in exercise of the executive power of the State,must satisfy Art.14 of the Constitution and if it is shown to be arbitrary,it must be struck down	Precedent
However,we have referred to certain provisions relating to initial appointment,termination or renewal of tenure to indicate that the action is controlled at least by settled guidelines,followed by the State of U.P.,for a long time	Precedent
This too is relevant for deciding the question of arbitrariness alleged in the present case	Precedent
35.It is now too well settled that every State action,in order to survive,must not be susceptible to the vice of arbitrariness which is the crux of Art.14 of the Constitution and basic to the rule of law,the system which governs us	Precedent
Arbitrariness is the very negation of the rule of law	Precedent
Satisfaction of this basic test in every State action is sine qua non to its validity and in this respect,the State cannot claim comparison with a private individual even in the field of contract	Precedent
This distinction between the State and a private individual in the field of contract has to be borne in the mind	Precedent
We in the facts and circumstances of this case do not see any arbitrariness on the part of the State in its action directing cancellation of appointments	Ratio of the decision
We may,on the other hand,notice that Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi 1990 Indlaw SC 463 (supra) has been distinguished by this Court in State of U.P.and Others v	Precedent
U.P.State Law Officers Association and Others [(1994) 2 SCC 204  1994 Indlaw SC 1289] stating: "The reliance placed by the respondents in this behalf on Shrilekha Vidyarthi v	Precedent
State of U.P.1990 Indlaw SC 463 is misplaced for the obvious reason that the decision relates to the appointment of the District Government Counsel and the Additional/Assistant District Government Counsel who are the law officers appointed by the State Government to conduct civil,criminal and revenue cases in any court other than the High Court	Precedent
Their appointments are made through open competition from among those who are eligible for appointment and strictly on the basis of merit as evidenced by the particulars of their practice,opinions of the District Magistrate and the District Judge and also after taking into consideration their character and conduct	Precedent
Their appointment is in the first instance for one year	Precedent
It is only after their satisfactory performance during that period that a deed of engagement is given to them,and even then the engagement is to be for a term not exceeding three years	Precedent
The renewal of their further term again depends upon the quality of work and conduct,capacity as a lawyer,professional conduct,public reputation in general,and character and integrity as certified by the District Magistrate and the District Judge	Precedent
For the said purpose,the District Magistrate and the District Judge are required to maintain a character roll and a record of the work done by the officer and the capacity displayed by him in discharge of the work	Precedent
His work is also subject to strict supervision	Precedent
The shortcomings in the work are required to be brought to the notice of the Legal Remembrancer	Precedent
It will thus be seen that the appointment of the two sets of officers,viz.,the Government Counsel in the High Court with whom we are concerned,and the District Government Counsel with whom the said decision was concerned,are made by dissimilar procedures	Precedent
The latter are not appointed as a part of the spoils system	Precedent
Having been selected on merit and for no other consideration,they are entitled to continue in their office for the period of the contract of their engagement and they can be removed only for valid reasons	Precedent
The people are interested in their continuance for the period of their contracts and in their non-substitution by those who may come in through the spoils system	Precedent
It is in these circumstances that this Court held that the wholesale termination of their services was arbitrary and violative of Art.14 of the Constitution	Precedent
The ratio of the said decision can hardly be applied to the appointments of the law officers in the High Court whose appointment itself was arbitrary and was made in disregard of Art.14 of the Constitution as pointed out above"[Emphasis added	Precedent
In Parshotam Lal Dhingra 1957 Indlaw SC 103	Precedent
supra),this Court held that whoever holds civil posts would be entitled to protection of their services in terms of Cl.(2) of Art.309 of the Constitution of India in the event any disciplinary action is taken against them stating: "The underlying idea obviously is that a provision like this will ensure to them a certain amount of security of tenure	Precedent
Cl.(2) protects government servants against being dismissed or removed or reduced in rank without being given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to them	Precedent
It will be noted that in cl.(1) the words dismissed and removed have been used while in cl.(2	Precedent
the words dismissed removed and reduced in rank have been used	Precedent
The two protections are (1) against being dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which the appointment had been made,and (2) against being dismissed,removed or reduced in rank without being heard	Precedent
What,then,is the meaning of those expressions dismissed removed or reduced in rank	Precedent
It has been said in Jayanti Prasad v	Precedent
State of Uttar Pradesh 1951 Indlaw ALL 27 that these are technical words used in cases in which a persons services are terminated by way of punishment	Precedent
Those expressions,it is urged,have been taken from the service rules,where they were used to denote the three major punishments and it is submitted that those expressions should be read and understood in the same sense and treated as words of Art	Precedent
In Dhirender Singh and Others v	Precedent
State of Haryana and Others [(1997) 2 SCC 712  1996 Indlaw SC 1725],termination of an order of promotion in favour of the appellant was not interfered with by this Court as the same had not been approved by the DIG,being the competent authority	Precedent
In M.C.Mehta v	Precedent
Union of India and Others [(1999) 6 SCC 237  1999 Indlaw SC 1396],this Court developed the "useless formality" theory stating: "More recently Lord Bingham has deprecated the useless formality theory in R.v	Precedent
Chief Constable of the Thames Valley Police Forces,ex p Cotton by giving six reasons.(See also his article Should Public Law Remedies be Discretionary	Precedent
1991 PL,64	Precedent
A detailed and emphatic criticism of the useless formality theory has been made much earlier in Natural Justice,Substance or Shadow by Prof.D.H.Clark of Canada (1975 PL,27 63) contending that Malloch and Glynn were wrongly decided	Precedent
Foulkes,Craig  and others say that the court cannot prejudge what is to be decided by the decision-making authority.de Smith says courts have not yet committed themselves to any one view though discretion is always with the court	Precedent
Wade says that while futile writs may not be issued,a distinction has to be made according to the nature of the decision	Precedent
Thus,in relation to cases other than those relating to admitted or indisputable facts,there is a considerable divergence of opinion whether the applicant can be compelled to prove that the outcome will be in his favour or he has to prove a case of substance or if he can prove a real likelihood of success or if he is entitled to relief even if there is some remote chance of success	Precedent
We may,however,point out that even in cases where the facts are not all admitted or beyond dispute,there is a considerable unanimity that the courts can,in exercise of their discretion,refuse certiorari,prohibition,mandamus or injunction even though natural justice is not followed	Precedent
We may also state that there is yet another line of cases as in State Bank of Patiala v	Precedent
S.K.Sharma,Rajendra Singh v	Precedent
State of M.P.1994 Indlaw MP 48 that even in relation to statutory provisions requiring notice,a distinction is to be made between cases where the provision is intended for individual benefit and where a provision is intended to protect public interest	Precedent
In the former case,it can be waived while in the case of the latter,it cannot be waived	Precedent
In Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan 2002 Indlaw SC 287 (supra),it was held: "It is clear that if after the termination of services of the said Dr	Precedent
K.C.Rakesh,the orders of appointment are issued,such orders are not valid	Precedent
If such appointment orders are a nullity,the question of observance of principles of natural justice would not arise	Precedent
In Bar Council of India v	Precedent
High Court of Kerala [(2004) 6 SCC 311  2004 Indlaw SC 340],it was stated: "Principles of natural justice,however,cannot be stretched too far	Precedent
Their application may be subject to the provisions of a statute or statutory rule	Precedent
In R.S.Garg v	Precedent
State of U.P.and Others [(2006) 6 SCC 430  2006 Indlaw SC 801],it was stated: "A discretionary power as is well known cannot be exercised in an arbitrary manner	Precedent
It is necessary to emphasize that the State did not proceed on the basis that the amendment to the Rules was not necessary	Precedent
The action of a statutory authority,as is well known,must be judged on the basis of the norms set up by it and on the basis of the reasons assigned therefor	Precedent
The same cannot be supplemented by fresh reasons in the shape of affidavit or otherwise	Precedent
For the reasons aforementioned,the impugned judgments cannot be sustained	Ruling by Present Court
They are set aside accordingly	Ruling by Present Court
The appeals are allowed	Ruling by Present Court
No costs	Ruling by Present Court
Appeal allowed	Ruling by Present Court
