u/s.48(2) of the Act up to the date of one month before filing that rectification application	Facts
A continuous period of 5 years or longer had passed and the trade mark had not been bona fide used by the respondent	Facts
Having regard to the extended nature of non-user of the concerned trade mark after November 1,1976,any further use of the said trade marks by the respondents was likely to deceive and cause confusion to the trade and public alike in India etc	Facts
Simultaneously,an application for registration of three trade marks An their favour was filed by the appellant on March 25,1982	Facts
By proceedings dated June 13,1984,the Registrar of Trade Marks informed the appellant that the registered user's applications were abandoned since the appellant failed to comply with the statutory requirements	Facts

Non registration of the user agreement by Sen Raleigh and the appellant was due to the default of the latter	Facts
The appellant had not taken any steps to withdraw registered user applications and as such should not be permitted to take such a contradictory stand of applying for rectification at the same time	Facts

The discretion,therefore,was not to be extended in favour of the appellant	Facts
Thus,this appeal by special leave	Facts
Shri Raju Ramchandran,learned senior counsel for the appellant,raised three-fold contentions	Argument
It is his pivotal contention that undisputedly when the respondent was not in urge of trade mark as "a registered proprietor" or its agent Sen Raleigh as Permitted user" for a period of 5 years immediately preceding the date of the application u/s.46 for removal of the trade mark from the Register,there was no bona fide user thereof in relation to those goods by the proprietor himself	Argument
The respondents admittedly did not use the same	Argument
The appellant cannot be said to be either the proprietor of the trade mark since 1976,since the agreement lapsed or permitted user-.The High Court therefore was wrong in holding that 5 years' period had not lapsed	Argument
The harmonious construction should be put up in such a way that S.48(2) and S.466 by of the Act could be permitted to have their-full play in their operational structure	Argument
The construction put up by the High Court renders sub-s.(2) of S.48 otiose or surplus age which interpretation is impermissible	Argument
It is contended that the registered user must be understood to be the user by the proprietor or authorized user registered under Section 48.The period of 5 years should be computed from that date of expiry of registered user	Argument
The Division Bench,therefore,was wrong in its conclusion that the appellant has failed to establish it	Argument
On the other hand,it is for the respondent to prove the same	Argument
He further contended that the special circumstances enumerated in sub-s.(3) of S.46 must be such that the respondents had intended to use the registered trade mark	Argument
For over a long period,the trade mark was not used by the respondents as its registered proprietor	Argument
The respondents did not prove that they were prevented to use the same for 5 years or more preceding the date of the application	Argument
The burden is on tile respondents to prove that non-user was due to special circumstance of the trade and not due to some other cause which would have operated whether special circumstances had arisen or not Since the respondents were not using the trade mark since April 20,1954,the plea of special circumstances is not available to the respondents	Argument
The Division Bench or the learned single Judge did not record any finding as to the period up to which the bicycles could be imported into India and the period during which the ban was imposed but for which the respondent had an intention to import bicycles but were prevented to do so due to the ban	Argument
In the absence of .such a findings the High Court was wrong in law in refusing to rectify the trade mark and striking it off the register	Argument
The Court while exercising its discretion u/s.46 should look into not only commercial interest of the parties but also public interest	Argument
In normal circumstances,when it is established that the trade mark was not used either by the registered proprietor or the permitted user,the public interest of supply of the quality of the goods marketed by the appellant should be taken into factual consideration for removal of the trade mark from the register	Argument
Shri Ashok Desai,learned senior counsel for respondents,resisted the contentions	Argument
According to the learned counsel,the respondents have collaboration agreement with Sen Raleigh which was taken over by the Government under IDR Act and the appellant came to manufacture,with the technical know-how supplied by the respondents,the Raleigh bicycles under the trade mark registered by the respondents in the register of the Registrar under the Act	Argument
The appellant was using the same as an agent	Argument
The operation of S.48(2) must be construed in such a way that the bona fide user even by a non-registered user,so long as there exist a rational connection between the proprietor of the trade mark and passes off the goods in the market manufactured by the appellant,is construed to be a bona fide user for and on behalf of the registered proprietor,namely,the respondents	Argument
Admitted position is that the respondent being the registered proprietor,until it is proved that its trade mark was not used to pass off the goods manufactured by the appellant and that the appellant had discontinued the user and 5 years lapsed thereafter,the non-use of the trade mark continues thereafter,the rectification application u/s.46 (1)(b) would be ordered	Argument
In view of the prohibition to import bicycles,the respondent was prevented to use the trade mark but by collaboration agreement,it was continuing to use the trade mark by the permitted user	Argument
The special circumstance is that the appellant filed an application for registration u/s.48(1) and continued it till it was abandoned	Argument
It would also be considered as a special circumstance for non user	Argument
The discretion exercised by the Court must be judged in the light of the facts and circumstances,The appellant having used the trade mark,it does not lie in the mouth of the appellant to contend that he is not a permitted user or a bona fide user of the trade mark	Argument
In view of the diverse contentions,the question arises: whether the High Court was right in refusing to rectify and strike off the trade marks of the respondents from the register of trade marks	Ratio of the decision
S.46(1)(b) reads as under	Statute
46.Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-use.-(1	Statute
Subject to the provisions of section 47,a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either - (a) xxx xxx xxx xxx (b) that up to a date of one month before the date of the application,a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being	Statute
Sub-s.(3) envisages that "an application shall not be entitled to rely for the purpose of clause (b) of sub-s.(1) or for purpose of sub-s.(2) on any non-use of a trade mark which is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade and not to any intention to abandon or not to use the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the application relates".S.48 provides for registered users which reads thus: '48.Registered users.-(1) Subject to the provisions of section 49,a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as the registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark; but the Central Government may,by rules made in this behalf,provide that no application for registration as such shall be entertained unless the agreement between the parties complies with the conditions laid down in the rules for preventing trafficking in trade marks.(2) permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be use by the proprietor thereof.and shall be used by a person the proprietor.for the purpose of s.46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under this Act or any other law	Statute
It would,thus,be apparent that subject to section 46,for a registered trade mark up to date within one month before the date of making application for rectification for a continuous period of 5 years or longer if registered trade mark had not been use during that period,there was no bona fide user in relation to those goods by the proprietor thereof for the time being	Statute
The trade mark should be taken off and struck out form the register of trade marks in respect of any goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered .Sub-s.(3) enables the registered proprietor to show special circumstances for the non use of the trade mark due to which circumstances in the trade,he could not use the trade mark for the above period and not with any intention to abandon the use of trade mark or not to use the trade mark in relation to good to which the application for rectification relates	Statute
Sub-s.(2) of S.48 give defence to "permitted user" in relation to a registered trade mark	Statute
It means the use of the trade mark by a registered user of the trade mark in relation to good with which he is connected in the course of trade and in respect of which the trade mark remains registered for the time being and for which he is registered as a registered user and which complies with any conditions or restrictions to which the registration of the trade marks is subjected to	Statute
S.48 (1) envisages that subject to the provisions of Section 49,a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as a "registered user" thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered otherwise than as defensive trade mark	Statute
The permitted use of trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof and shall be deemed no to be used by a person other than the proprietor for the purpose of S.46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under the Act or any other law	Statute
The Central Government is empowered to prevent trafficking in trade mark	Statute
It would,therefore,be clear that a permitted use of the trade mark should be done under sub-s.(1) of Section 48.It	Ratio of the decision
Should be either by the registered proprietor of the trade mark or a person other than the registered proprietor registered u/s.48(1) to use the trade mark by operation of sub-section (2).An un-registered person u/s.48(1) or a person who did not register u/s.(1) of S.48 shall not be deemed to be a registered user for the purpose of S.46 or any other law	Ratio of the decision
The High Court recorded a finding and it is not disputed across the bar,that the appellant had entered into an agreement with Sen Raleigh which was a permitted user and used the trade mark till November 1,1976 and thereafter by registered user agreement dated December 20,1976 used trade mark for a period of 5 years	Ratio of the decision
It is not in dispute that till date of filing of the application,the appellant used the trade mark in passing off the bicycles under the trade mark of the respondent	Ratio of the decision
The question,therefore,is: whether the appellant must be deemed to be bona fide user of the trade mark,though there was no agreement nor was it registered as permitted user u/s.48(1	Ratio of the decision
on admitted position and in the facts and circumstances,we are of the view that the appellant was a ago user of the trade mark of the respondent in passing off the bicycles under the trade mark of the respondent who,admittedly,is a registered proprietor	Ratio of the decision
It is true,as held by this Court,that to get a trade mark registered without any intention to use it in relation to any goods but merely to make money out of it by selling it to others,the right to use it as a commodity would be trafficking in that trade mark	Ratio of the decision
It requires to be prevented and prohibited	Ratio of the decision
The Court would not lend assistance to such registered proprietors of the trade mark	Ratio of the decision
There must be real trade connection between the proprietor of the trade and licensee of the goods and the intention to use the trade mark must exist at the date of the application for registration of trade mark and such intention must be genuine and bona fide and continue to subsist in order to disprove the charge of trafficking in trade mark	Ratio of the decision
It is a question of fact in every case	Ratio of the decision
The question is: whether the trade connection exists to dispel the charge of trafficking in the trade mark	Ratio of the decision
This question was considered by this Court in American Home Products Corporation vs	Precedent
Mac Laboratories Pvt.Ltd and Anr.1985 Indlaw SC 464 and they need no reiteration	Precedent
It is seen that preceding the nationalization of the Cycle manufacturing industry under the IDR Act,the respondent had a collaboration agreement with Sen Raliegh who was a registered user under Section 48.From him,the appellant came to succeed by statutory operation	Ratio of the decision
It was,therefore,not a case of getting the trade mark registered under the Predecessor Act and continuing under the Act for trafficking of the trade mark	Ratio of the decision
It is true that u/s.43(1) either the registered proprietor or a permitted person is required to register as permitted user	Ratio of the decision
The benefit of S.46 would be available during the period for which the agreement registered and user continued in furtherance thereof	Ratio of the decision
It appears that even an unregistered licensee,so long as there is unbroken Connection in the course of the trade between the licensor and the passing off lincesee's goods under the trade mark,there would be sufficient connection in the course of the trade between the proprietor and bona fide user of the trade mark by unregistered user	Ratio of the decision
It must,therefore,be held that though the deemed presumption under sub-s.(2) of S.48 is referable to the permitted user or the registered user and it does not extend to unregistered permitted user,the Connecting link of passing off the goods between the licensor's trade mark and the lincesee should bona fide be with the permission or Consent which may be express or implied by long course of dealings	Ratio of the decision
It would connect the registered proprietor and the user of the trade mark by the unregistered lincesee	Ratio of the decision
The appellant must be presumed by course of conduct that he is a bona fide user for the purpose of S.46(1)(b	Ratio of the decision
In K.R Beri and Co.vs	Precedent
The Metal Godds Mfg	Precedent
Co Pvt Limited and Anr	Precedent
AIR 1980 Delhi 299 1980 Indlaw DEL 180],the Division Bench construed S.48(2) and held that an unregistered user of the trade mark even With the consent of the proprietor cannot be construed to be a registered user u/s.48(1) and such construction renders sub-s.(2) of S.48 surplus age or otios,which is impermissible by statutory construction	Precedent
We have given anxious consideration to the reasoning therein	Precedent
On strict interpretation,the view of the Division Bench may be correct but it is not correct to hold that by a bona fide user of an unregistered user when connection between the proprietor of the trade mark and the permitted user in relation to passing off the goods under the trade mark are proved,it does not render sub-section (2) of S.48 surplus age or otios	Precedent
It is true that the burden flies on the registered proprietor of the trade mark to establish the exceptions provided under S.46(3).Equally,the applicant for rectification also prima facie shows non-user for the relevant period	Precedent
Then the burden shifts to the proprietor of the trade mark to affirmatively prove the special Circumstances for non-user of trade mark	Precedent
It must be shown that the non-use of the trade mark is due to special circumstances of the trade and not due to some other Cause which would have operated,whether the special Circumstances had arisen off not	Precedent
Although the special circumstances of trade taken by themselves would have prevented the use of the trade mark	Precedent
If the non-user was,in fact,due to some other circumstances and would have occured whether the circumstances had followed or not,subs.(3) would not apply	Precedent
It must,therefore,be duty of the registered proprietor to show What non-user was strictly due to the special circumstances of trade and not of any intention on the part of the registered proprietor not to use the trade mark during the relevant period	Precedent
Though there was a ban on impart of the Raleigh cycles manufactured outside India and passed off under the registered mark of the respondents as a registered proprietor,the circumstances do not attracted sub-section (3) of S.46 to relieve the respondents to establish non-user,but on the facts of this case,we have the admitted position that Sen Raleigh,admittedly,was a registered user through which the appellant had bona fide used the registered trade mark of the registered proprietor There is no discontinuance or non-use of the trade mark by the respondent to establish the special circumstances in this case	Ratio of the decision
It is also not necessary to go into the question whether the application filed by the appellant u/s.48(1) and its pendency would be a special circumstance in favour of the respondent	Ratio of the decision
Suffice it to hold that subs.(3) of S.46	Ratio of the decision
is not attracted to the facts in this case	Ratio of the decision
The question then is: whether the discretion has been properly exercised by both the Division Bench as well the single Judge in refusing to take off the trade mark from the register by striking off trade mark from the register of the Registrar of Trade Marks	Ratio of the decision
It is true that while exercising discretion,the Court u/s.46 of the Act should take into consideration not only commercial interest of the parties but also public interest: In para 21.82 at page 386 of the law of Trade Marks and passing-off by P.Narayanan (4th Ed.),it is stated that the Court or the Registrar has discretion in granting or refusing an application for rectification	Ratio of the decision
Ordinarily,however,the mark will be expunged (taken off) when the factual circumstances necessary for the removal are established unless it is shown that the case comes within the exceptions provided in the sub-section (3).The High Court refused to exercise the discretion to strike off the trade mark from the register	Ratio of the decision
It is seen that the appellant had not abandoned,at any point of time,the use of the trade mark of the respondent-registered proprietor till filing of the application	Ratio of the decision
Though the appellant has not used the trade mark by itself since 1954 and after the expiry of the permitted use by Sen Raleigh until the notice was issued by the respondent directing the appellant not to use the trade mark,the appellant came to use the same in passing off bicycles manufactured by it under trade mark of the respondent	Ratio of the decision
It is not relevant for the purpose of S.46(1)(b) whether the bicycles were manufactured with the assistance of technical know-how passed on by Sen Raleigh or the permitted user	Ratio of the decision
Suffice it to state that the appellant,as a fact,had used the trade mark of the respondent in passing off the bicycles manufactured by it	Ratio of the decision
The High Court,in our view,declined,for good reasons,to rectify the trade mark under Section Act b) of the Act	Ratio of the decision
We are also not persuaded to take a different view from that of the High Court	Ratio of the decision
In these circumstances,we are of the view that the High Court has properly exercised its discretion and refused to rectify and strike off the trade mark,from the register of trade marks of the Registrar	Ratio of the decision
The appeal is accordingly dismissed but,in the circumstances,without costs	Ruling by Present Court
