Written statements were filed by the appellants and by Susilabala and the two sons of Jogendra denying the claims of the idol and contending inter alia that there was no valid or absolute dedication of the suit properties I to the idol and that the said premises had been respectively acquired by them by adverse possession and that the title of the idol thereto had been extinguished	Facts
The said suit was heard by Mr. Justice Bose who declared the premises	Ruling by Lower Court
No. 41-A	Ruling by Present Court
Grey Street to be the absolute property of the idol and made the other declarations in favour of the idol as prayed for	Ruling by Lower Court

Grey Street as, in his opinion, Sushilabala as executrix to her husband's estate and her two sons had acquired title to the said premises by adverse possession and the title of the idol thereto had been extinguished	Ruling by Lower Court
The appellants filed on the 18th August, 1950, an appeal against this judgment being Appeal No. 118 of 1950	Facts
The idol filed on the 20th November, 1950, cross-objections against the decree for Rs	Facts
19,000 and interest thereon as also the dismissal of the suit in regard to the premises	Facts

19,000 filed by the idol against the appellants	Ruling by Lower Court
In regard however to the cross-objection relating to premises	Ruling by Lower Court
Grey Street which was directed against Sushilabala and the two sons of jogendra the learned judges held that the cross-objection against the co-respondents was not maintainable and dismissed the same with costs	Ruling by Lower Court
The appellants filed on the 31st May, 1951, an application for leave to prefer an appeal to this court against the said judgment and decree of the High Court at Calcutta	Facts
A certificate u/art	Facts
133(1) of theConstitution was granted on the 4th June, 1951, and the High Court admitted the appeal finally on the 6th August, 1951	Facts
On the 22nd November, 1951, the idol applied to the High Court for leave to file cross-objections against that part of the judgment and decree of the High Court,which dismissed its claims with regard to the premises No.40/2-A Grey Street	Facts
The High Court rejected the said application stating that there was no rule allowing cross-objections in the Supreme Court	Ruling by Lower Court
The said cross-objections were however printed as additional record	Ruling by Lower Court
By an order made by this court on the 24th May, 1953, the petition of the idol for filing cross-objections in this court was allowed to be treated as a petition for special leave to appeal against that part of the decree which was against it, subject to any question as to limitation	Facts
The appeal as also the petition for special leave to appeal mentioned above came on for hearing and final disposal before us	Facts
The appeal was argued but so far as the petition for special leave to appeal was concerned the parties came to an agreement whereby the idol asked for leave to withdraw the petition on certain terms recorded between the parties	Facts
The petition for special leave was therefore allowed to be withdrawn and no objection now survives in regard to the decree passed by the trial court dismissing the idol's claim to the premises, No. 40/2-A	Facts
The appeal is concerned only with the premises	Ratio of the decision
It was contended on behalf of the appellants that the, dedication of the premises	Argument
NO	Argument
41 Grey Street made by Dwarka Nath under the terms of his will was a. partial dedication, and that his sons Rajendra and jogendra and his widow Golap Sundari, who were appointed sevayats of the idol were competent to deal with premises	Argument
No. 41	Ratio of the decision
Grey Street after making the due provision for the idol as they purported to do by the terms of settlement, dated the 24th November, 1910	Argument
It was further contended that Nagendra, by virtue of the award dated the 12th October, 1920, claimed to be absolutely entitled to the premises	Argument
Grey Street and that his possession of the said premises thereafter became adverse which adverse possession continued for upwards of 12 years extinguishing the right of the idol to the said premises	Argument
The first contention of the appellants is clearly untenable on the very language of the will of Dwarka Nath	Ratio of the decision
Cl	Ratio of the decision
3 of the said will provided "With a view to provide a permanent habitation for the said deity, I do by means of this will, dedicate the aforesaid immovable property the said house	Ratio of the decision

etc	Ratio of the decision
of the said Sri Sri Issur Sridhar Jew Salagram Sila Thakur and on the death of my said two sons their representatives, successors and heirs shall successively perform the sheba in the aforesaid manner and the executors appointed by this will of mine having got the said two properties registered in the Calcutta Municipality in the name of the said Sri Sri Issur Sridhar Jew Thakur shall pay the municipal taxes, etc	Ratio of the decision
and shall take the municipal bills in his name	Ratio of the decision
None of my representatives heirs, successors, executors, administrators or assigns shall have any manner of interest in or right to the said two debutter properties and no one shall ever be competent to give away or effect sale, mortgage or in respect of the said two properties nor shall the said two properties, be sold on account of the debts of any one	Ratio of the decision
t is quite true,that a dedication may be either absolute or partial	Ratio of the decision
The property may be given out and out to the idol, or it may be subjected to a charge in favour of the idol	Ratio of the decision
The question whether the idol itself shall be considered the true beneficiary, subject to a charge in favour of the heirs or specified relatives of the testator for their upkeep, or that, on the other hand, these heirs shall be considered the true beneficiaries of the property, subject to a charge for the upkeep, worship and expenses of the idol, is a question which can only be settled by a conspectus of the entire provisions of the will": Pande Har Narayan v. Surja Kunwari, [1921] L. R. 48 I. A. 143, 145, 146 1921 Indlaw PC 56	Precedent
What we find here in cl	Ratio of the decision
3 of the will is an absolute dedication of the premises	Ratio of the decision
Grey Street to the idol as its permanent habitation with only the right given to the sevayats to reside in the said premises for the purposes of carrying on the daily and periodical seva and the festivals, etc	Ratio of the decision
of the deity	Ratio of the decision
The said premises are expressly declared as dedicated to the deity	Ratio of the decision
They are to be registered in the municipal records in the name of the deity, the municipal bills have got to be taken also in his name and none of the testator's representatives, heirs, successors, executors, administrators or assigns is to have any manner of interest in or right to the said premises or is to be competent to give away or effect sale, mortgage, etc	Ratio of the decision
of the said premises	Ratio of the decision
There is thus a clear indication of the intention of the testator to absolutely dedicate the said premises to the deity and it is impossible to urge that there was a partial dedication of the premises to the deity	Ratio of the decision
The only thing which was urged by Shri N. C. Chatterjee in support of his contention was that the right to reside in the premises was given to the sevayats and that according to him detracted from the absolute character of the dedication	Argument
This argument however cannot avail the appellants	Ratio of the decision
It was observed by Lord Buckmaster in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Gnanendra Nath Das v. Surendra Nath Das, (1920) 24 C.W.N. 1926 at p. 1030	Precedent
In that case it is provided that the shebait for the time being shall be entitled to reside with his family in the said dwelling-house, but the dwelling-house itself is the place specially set apart for the family idols to which specific reference is made in the will, and in their Lordships' opinion the gift is only a perfectly reasonable arrangement to secure that the man in whose hands the supervision of the whole estate is vested should have associated with his duties the right to reside in this named dwelling place	Precedent
The first contention of the appellants therefore fails and we hold that the dedication of the premises	Ruling by Present Court
41 Grey, Street to the idol was an absolute dedication	Ruling by Present Court
regards the second contention, viz., the adverse possession of Nagendra, it is to be noted that under the terms of cl. 3 of the will of Dwarka Nath the representatives, successors and heirs of his two sons Rajendra and Jogendra were successively to perform the seva in the manner therein mentioned and Nagendra was one of the heirs and legal representatives Of Rajendra	Ratio of the decision
He was no doubt a minor on the 24th November, 1910, when the terms of settlement were arrived at between the parties to the suit 1909	Ratio of the decision
His two elder brothers Jnanendra and Bhupendra were declared to be the then sevayats, but a right was reserved to Nagendra to join with them as a sevayat on, his attaining majority	Ratio of the decision
So far as Nagendra is concerned there is a clear finding of fact recorded by Mr. Justice Bose on a specific issue raised in that behalf, viz	Ratio of the decision
Did Nagendra act as shebait of the plaintiff deity under the wills of Dwarka Nath Ghosh and Rajendra Nath Ghosh	Ratio of the decision
that he did act as such shebait and that his possession of the premises	Ratio of the decision
No. 41A	Ratio of the decision
Grey Street was referable to possession on behalf of the idol, 30 .This finding was not challenged in the appeal court and it is too late to challenge the same before us	Ratio of the decision
If Nagendra was thus a sevayat of the idol it could not be urged that his possession could in any manner whatever be adverse to the idol and his dealings with the said premises in the manner he purported to do after the 12th October, 1920, could not be evidence of any adverse possession against the idol	Ratio of the decision
he position of the sevayat and the effect of his dealings with the property dedicated to the idol has been expounded by Rankin C.J. in Surendrakrishna Ray v. Shree Shree Ishwar Bhubaneshwari Thakuran, (1933	Precedent
Cal 54 1932 Indlaw CAL 59	Precedent
But, in the present case, we have to see whether the possession of two joint shebaits becomes adverse to the idol when they openly claim to divide the property between them	Precedent
The fact of their possession is in accordance with the idol's title, and the question is whether the change made by them, in the intention with which they hold, evidenced by an application of the rents and profits to their own purposes and other acts, extinguishes the idol's right	Precedent
I am quite unable to hold that it does, because such a change of intention can only be brought home to the idol by means of the shebait's knowledge and the idol can only react to it by the shebait	Precedent
Adverse possession,in such circumstances is a notion almost void of content	Precedent
True, any heir or perhaps any descendant of the founder can bring a suit	Precedent
against the shebaits on the idol's behalf and, in the present case, it may be said that the acts of the shebaits must have I been notorious in the family	Precedent
But such persons have no legal duty to protect the endowment and, until the shebait is removed or controlled by the court, he alone can act for the idol	Precedent
We are in perfect accord with the observations made by Rankin C.J	Ruling by Present Court
If a shebait by acting contrary to the terms of his appointment or in breach of his duty as such shebait could claim adverse possession of the dedicated property against the idol it would be putting a premium on dishonesty and breach of duty on his part and no property which is dedicated to an idol would ever be safe	Ruling by Present Court
The shebait for the time being is the only person competent to safeguard the interests of the idol, his possession of the dedicated property is the possession of the idol whose sevait he is, and no dealing of his with the property dedicated to the idol could afford the basis of a claim by him for adverse possession of the property against the idol	Ruling by Present Court
No shebait can, so long as he continues to be the sevait, ever claim adverse possession against the idol	Ruling by Present Court
Neither Nagendra nor the appellants who derive their title from the auction sale held on the 9th December, 1936, could therefore claim to have perfected their title to the premises	Ruling by Present Court
Grey Street by adverse possession	Ruling by Present Court
The second contention of the appellants also therefore fails	Ruling by Present Court
The further contention urged on behalf of the appellants in regard to the disallowance of the sum of Rs	Ruling by Present Court
19,000 by the appeal court could not be and was not seriously pressed before us and does not require any consideration	Ruling by Present Court
he result therefore is that the appeal fails and must stand dismissed with costs	Ruling by Present Court
Appeal dismissed	Ruling by Present Court
