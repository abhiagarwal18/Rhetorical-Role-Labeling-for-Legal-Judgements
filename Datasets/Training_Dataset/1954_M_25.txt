This appeal with special leave is directed against the judgment and order of the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India in a dispute regarding the workers' claim for bonus	Facts
During the year 1948 the appellant made a profit of Rs	Facts
11,97,648-11-9	Facts
It paid 24 3 per cent	Facts
dividend on ordinary shares, being the maximum that could be paid under the Public Companies (Limitation of Dividend) Ordinance of 1948 and also paid to the workers their full share of bonus at annas 4 in a rupee of their basic earnings	Facts
During the year 1949 the selling rates for cloth and yarn were controlled by the Government and were approximately 4 per cent	Facts
below those obtained in 1948	Facts
The basic wages were increased from the 1st December, 1948, by order of the Government of Uttar Pradesh and the total wages paid were therefore higher than those in the previous year	Facts
There was moreover indiscipline amongst the workers and production suffered	Facts
There was a strike in the month of October and the mills were closed for nearly a month	Facts
Further the management were unable to secure cotton which resulted in the curtailment of the working hours	Facts
As a result of all these circumstances the appellant suffered a trading loss of Rs	Facts
5,02,563-1-10	Facts
A sum of Rs	Facts
2,50,000 being the excess reserve for taxation was written back and a sum of Rs	Facts
10,01,871-13-5 being the amount of reserve transferred from the investment account was also brought in	Facts
An aggregate sum of Rs	Facts
12,51,871-13-5 was thus brought into the balance sheet by these two transfers	Facts
The trading loss was deducted from this amount leaving a credit balance of Rs	Facts
7,49,308-11-7 and that amount was shown as the profit for the year 1949 in the balance-sheet for that year	Facts
The balance which had been brought forward from the previous year was added thereto and a dividend of 243/4 per cent. was paid to the ordinary shareholders	Facts
The appellant also paid ex gratia to the workmen bonus at the rate of annas 2 per rupee of their basic earnings making it clear by their notification dated the 7th April, 1950, that the directors had sanctioned the payment at that rate in spite of the appellant having suffered a trading loss for the year, that it was being paid entirely at the discretion of the appellant and was not related to or connected with any contract of employment of any worker	Facts
On the 4th May, 1950, the Secretary of the respondent Union petitioned to the Provincial Conciliation Officer (Textile) that there was more production in 1949 than in 1948, that there was no reason to hold that the profit in 1949 was less than in the previous year and that the rate of bonus was wrongly reduced and asked that bonus for 1949 should also be paid at the rate of annas 4 per rupee	Facts
The industrial dispute which thus arose was referred for enquiry and recording of an award to the Regional Conciliation Board (Textile), Kanpur	Facts
The Conciliation Board by a majority decision repelled the contention of the appellant and awarded the payment of bonus at annas 4 per rupee	Facts
On an appeal taken by the appellant to the Industrial Court (Textiles and Hosiery), Kanpur, the Industrial Court accepted the contention of the appellant, allowed the appeal and set aside the award	Facts
The respondent thereupon appealed to the Labour Appellate Tribunal which substantially agreed with the Industrial Court on questions of fact as well as the general position in law but imported considerations of social justice and treating this as a special case " where social justice would demand that labour should have bonus for the year where for that very year capital had not only a reasonable return but much in excess of that ", allowed the appeal and directed the appellant to pay to the workmen bonus at the rate of annas 4 per rupee within six weeks of their decision	Facts
The appellant filed this appeal against that decision after obtaining special leave from this Court	Facts
Both the Industrial Court as well as the Labour Appellate Tribunal found as a fact that there was a trading loss of Rs	Facts
5,02,563-1-10 during the year 1949 and also	Facts
that the dividend of 243/4 per cent	Facts
to the ordinary shareholders was distributed after transferring the aggregate sum of Rs	Facts
12,51,871-13-5 from the reserves	Facts
The question which therefore arises for our consideration is mainly whether the workers are entitled to the payment of a bonus in spite of the employer having worked at a loss during the year and incidentally whether the workers have any right, title or interest in the reserves and the undistributed profits of the previous years	Ratio of the decision
The primary meaning of the word " bonus " according to the definition given in the New English Dictionary is:-" A boon or gift over and above what is nominally due as remuneration to the receiver and which is therefore something wholly to the good	Ratio of the decision
This definition was adopted by Stirling J. in In re Eddystone Marine Insurance Co, L. R. (I894) W. N. 30; Webster's International Dictionary defines bonus as "something given in addition to what is ordinarily received by or strictly due to the recipient	Ratio of the decision
The Oxford Concise Dictionary defines it as " something to the good, into the bargain (and as an example) gratuity to workmen beyond their wages	Ratio of the decision
Corpus Juris Secundum, Volume XI, at page 515 ascribes the following meanings to the word bonus: " An allowance in addition to what is usual current or stipulated ; a sum given or paid beyond what is legally required to be paid to the recipient; something given in addition to what is ordinarily received by or strictly due to the recipient" and adds: It has been said to carry the idea of something uncertain and indefinite, something which may or may not be paid depending on varying circumstances and under particular conditions has been said to imply a benefit accruing to him who offers it and an inducement to the offeree	Ratio of the decision
This imports the conception of a boon, a gift or a gratuity otherwise described as an ex gratia payment	Ratio of the decision
The word 'bonus' has however acquired a secondary meaning in the sphere of industrial relations	Ratio of the decision
It is classified amongst the methods of wage payment	Ratio of the decision
It has been used especially in the United States of America to designate an award in addition to the contractual wage	Ratio of the decision
It is usually intended as a stimulus to extra effort but sometimes represents the desire of the employer to share with his workers the fruits of their common enterprise	Ratio of the decision
Vide Encyclopaedia Britannica, Volume III, page 856	Ratio of the decision
The Pocket Part of the Corpus Juris Secundum, Volume XI, under the heading "As Compensation for Services" quotes the following passage from Attorney-General v. City of Woburn, 317 Mass. 465 :- "The word 'bonus' is commonly used to denote an increase in salary or wages in contracts of employment	Ratio of the decision
The offer of a bonus is the means frequently adopted to secure continuous service from an employee to enhance his efficiency and to augment his loyalty to his employer and the employee's acceptance of the offer by performing the things called for by the offer binds employer to pay the bonus so called	Ratio of the decision
It also gives another meaning of the word bonus', viz:- "Increased compensation for services already rendered gratuitously or for a prescribed compensation where there is neither express or implied understanding that additional compensation may be granted	Ratio of the decision
This imports the conception that even though the payment be not strictly due to the recipient nor legally enforceable by him, a claim to the same may be laid by the employee under certain conditions and if such claim is entertained either by an agreement with the employer or by adjudication before a properly constituted Tribunal as on an industrial dispute arising	Ratio of the decision
the same would ripen into a legally enforceable claim	Ratio of the decision
This position was recognised in Sutton v. Attorney-General , (1923	Precedent
T.L.R. 294, 297; where the Earl of Birkenhead observed "The term 'bonus' may of course be properly used to describe payments made of grace and not as of right	Precedent
But it nevertheless may also include, as here, payments made because legally due but which the parties contemplate will not continue indefinitely", and in National Association of Local Government Officers v. Bolton Corporation, [1943	Precedent
A.C. 166, I87; "This payment, if made, cannot properly in my opinion be regarded as a mere gratuity	Precedent
Though there is an element of bounty in it the bounty, if granted, is given for good reasons of national policy	Precedent
I do not see why this does not fall within the definition of trade dispute just as much as a dispute as to the rate of wages or salary	Precedent
To a similar effect are the observations in Kenicott v. Supervisors of Wayne County, (1873) 83 U.S. 452 21 L., Ed	Precedent
But second, the meaning of the word 'bonus' is not given to it by the objection	Precedent
It is thus defined by Webster	Precedent
A premium given for a loan or a charter or other privilege granted to a company; as, the bank paid a bonus for its charter; a sum paid in addition to a stated compensation	Precedent
It is not a gift or gratuity, but a sum paid for services, or upon a consideration in addition to or in excess of that which would ordinarily be given" , 12	Precedent
And also in Great Western Garment Co. Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue , (1948	Precedent
D.L.R. 25, 233	Precedent
A bonus may be a mere gift or gratuity as a gesture of goodwill and not enforceable, or it may be something which an employee is entitled to on the happening of a condition precedent and is enforceable when the condition is fulfilled	Precedent
But in both cases it is something in addition to or in excess of that which is ordinarily received	Precedent
The Textile Labour Inquiry Committee defined 'bonus' as follows :- "The term bonus is applied to a cash payment made in addition to wages	Precedent
It generally represents the cash incentive given conditionally on certain standards of attendance and efficiency being attained	Precedent
There are however two conditions which have to be satisfied before a demand for bonus can be justified and they are, (1) when wages fall short of the living standard and (2) the industry makes huge profits part of which are due to the contribution which the workmen make in increasing production	Ratio of the decision
The demand for bonus becomes an industrial claim when either or both these conditions are satisfied	Ratio of the decision
The principles for the grant of bonus were discussed and a formula was evolved by the Full Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in Millowners' Association, Bombay v. Rashtreeya Mill Mazdoor Sangh, Bombay, (1950	Ratio of the decision
2 L.L.J. 247;"As	Ratio of the decision
both labour and capital contribute to the earnings of the industrial concern, it is fair that labour should derive some benefit, if there is a surplus after meeting prior or necessary charges" and the following were prescribed as the first charges on gross profits, viz	Ratio of the decision
1) Provision for depreciation, (2) Reserves for rehabilitation, (3) A return at 6 per cent	Ratio of the decision
on the paid up capital	Ratio of the decision
A return on the working capital at a lesser rate than the return on paid up capital	Ratio of the decision
The surplus that remained after meeting the aforesaid deductions would be available for distribution as bonus	Ratio of the decision
It is therefore clear that the claim for bonus can be made by the employees only if as a result of the joint contribution of capital and labour the industrial concern has earned profits	Ratio of the decision
If in any particular year the working of the industrial concern has resulted in loss there is no basis nor justification for a demand for bonus	Ratio of the decision
Bonus is not a deferred wage	Ratio of the decision
Because if it were so it would necessarily rank for precedence before dividends' The dividends can only be paid out of profits and unless and until profits are made no occasion or question can also arise for distribution of any sum as bonus amongst the employees	Ratio of the decision
If the industrial concern has resulted in a trading loss, there would be no profits of the particular year available for distribution of dividends, much less could the employees claim the distribution of bonus during that year	Ratio of the decision
This has been clearly recognised even in the various decisions of the Labour Appellate Tribunal, e.g., Nizam Sugar Factory Ltd., Hyderabad v. Their Workmen, (1952	Ratio of the decision
I L.L.J. 386; Textile Mills, Madhya Pradesh v. Their Workmen, (1952) 2 L.L.J. 625;and Famous Cine Laboratory v. Their Workmen, (1953	Ratio of the decision
I	Ratio of the decision
L.L.J. 466;This was also the basis of the demand of the respondent in the case before us, its case being that the appellant had reaped substantial profits during the year 1949	Ratio of the decision
This case was negatived by the Industrial Court as well as the Labour Appellate Tribunal, both of whom held that the working of the appellant during the year 1949 had resulted in a loss	Facts
Whereas the Industrial Court declined to grant the respondent any relief because the working of the appellant during the year had resulted in a loss, the Labour Appellate Tribunal made a special case for the respondent in spite of its concurrence with that finding of the Industrial Court	Facts
It is significant to observe that this principle was accepted by the Labour Appellate Tribunal itself	Facts
As at present advised a claim for bonus which had been rested on profits earned should ordinarily be determined on the basis of the profits earned in the year under claim and that the scale of bonus should be determined on the quantum of profits earned in the year	Ruling by Lower Court
So, it would follow that if there is trading loss in the year under claim, bonus should not ordinarily be awarded	Ruling by Lower Court
It however observed: " But, in our opinion, that should not be the universal rule	Ruling by Lower Court
Considerations of social justice cannot be disregarded altogether, in relations between capital and labour	Ruling by Lower Court
There may be special cases, and we consider the case before us to be one, where social justice would demand that labour should have bonus for the year where for that very year capital had not only a.. reasonable return but much in excess of that	Ruling by Lower Court
The Labour Appellate Tribunal did not accept the contention of the respondent that bonus should be linked to dividends nor did it rest its decision on the respondent having a right, title and interest in the reserves and the undistributed profits of the appellant	Facts
Linking of bonus to dividend would obviously create difficulties	Facts
Because if that theory was accepted a company would not declare any dividends but accumulate the profits, build up reserves and distribute those profits in the shape of bonus shares or reduce the capital in which event the workers would not be entitled to claim anything as and by way of bonus	Ratio of the decision
The workers not being members of the company would also not have any right, title and interest in the reserves or the undistributed profits which would form part of the assets of the company	Ratio of the decision
Even on a winding up of a company the property of the company would be applied in satisfaction of its liabilities pari passu and, unless the articles of association of the company otherwise provided, in distribution amongst the members according to their rights and interest in the company	Ratio of the decision
The employees would in no event be entitled to any share or interest in the assets and the capital of the company	Ratio of the decision
A transfer of moneys from these reserves or the undistributed profits would therefore not enure for the benefit of the workers	Ratio of the decision
The shareholders only would be entitled to such benefit and the mere fact that dividends were declared and paid to the shareholders out of such reserves and undistributed profits would not entitle the workers to demand bonus when in fact the working of the industrial concern during the particular year had showed a loss	Ratio of the decision
It has also got to be remembered that the labour force employed in an industrial concern is a fluctuating body and it cannot be predicated of the labour force in a particular year that it represents the past and the present workers, so that it can claim to demand bonus out of the reserves or undistributed profits of the Previous years	Ratio of the decision
On the accounts of each year being made up and the profits of the industrial concern being ascertained the workers during the particular year have their demand for bonus fully satisfied out of the surplus profits and the balance of profits is allocated and carried over in the accounts	Ratio of the decision
No further claimed payment of bonus out of those reserves or undistributed profits can therefore survive	Ratio of the decision
To admit the claim for bonus out of the reserves transferred to the profit and loss account would tantamount to allowing a second bonus on the same profits in respect of which the workers had already received their full bonus in the previous year	Ratio of the decision
The labour force which earns the profits of a particular year by collaborating with the employers is distinct from the one which contributed to the profits of the previous years and there is no continuity between the labour forces which are employed in the industrial concern during the several years	Ratio of the decision
The ratio which applies in the case of the shareholders who acquire the right, title and interest of their predecessorsin-interest does not apply to the labour force and the fact that the shareholders get a dividend by transfer of funds from the reserves and undistributed profits of the previous years would not entitle the workers to demand bonus out of those funds if the working of the industrial concern during the particular year has resulted in a trading loss	Ratio of the decision
The considerations of social justice imported by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in arriving at the decision in favour of the respondent were not only irrelevant but untenable	Ratio of the decision
Social justice is a very vague and indeterminate expression and no clear-cut definition can be laid down which will cover all the situations	Ratio of the decision
Mr. Isaacs, the learned counsel for the respondent	Argument
attempted to give a definition in the following terms : "social justice connotes the balance of adjustments of the various interests concerned in the social and economic structure of the State, in order to promote harmony upon an ethical and economic basis" and he stated that there were three parties concerned here, viz	Argument
the employers, the labour and the State itself, and the conception of social justice had to be worked out in this context	Argument
Without embarking upon a discussion as to the exact connotation of the expression "social justice" we may only observe that the concept of social justice does not emanate from the fanciful notions of any particular adjudicator but must be founded on a more solid foundation	Argument
Indeed the Full Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal evolved the abovequoted formula with a view to dispensing social justice between the various parties concerned	Facts
It adopted the following method of approach at page 1258 of that judgment :- "Our approach to this problem is motivated by the requirement that we should ensure and achieve industrial peace which is essential for the development and expansion of industry	Ruling by Lower Court
This can be achieved by having a contented labour force on the one hand, and on the other hand an investing public who would be attracted to the industry by a steady and progressive return on capital which the, industry may be able to offer	Ruling by Lower Court
This formula was reiterated in Textile Mills, M. P	Precedent
Their Workmen, (1952) 2 L.L.J. 625; and Famous Cine Laboratory v. Their Workmen, (1953) 1 L.L.J. 466; and in the latter case it deprecated the idea of adjudicators importing considerations of social justice which were not comprised in that formula :- "And what is social justice	Precedent
Social justice is not the fancy of any individual adjudicator; if it were so then ideas of social justice might vary from adjudicator to adjudicator over all parts of India	Precedent
In our Full Bench decision (See 1950, 2 L.L.J. 1247), we carefully considered the question of social justice in relation to bonus, and there we equated the rights and liabilities of employers and workmen with a view to achieving a just formula for the computation of bonus	Precedent
That Full Bench decision stands, and this tribunal and all other tribunals are bound by it	Precedent
Without committing ourselves to the acceptance of the above formula in its entirety we may point out that the Labour Appellate Tribunal did not apply its own formula to the facts of the present case	Ratio of the decision
It is also significant to note that even while importing considerations of social justice the Labour Appellate Tribunal was oblivious of the fact that it was by their own acts of indiscipline and strike that the workers of the appellant company themselves contributed, to the trading losses incurred by the appellant and it hardly lay in their mouth then to contend that they were none the less entitled to a payment of bonus commensurate with the dividend paid to the shareholders out of the undistributed profits of the previous years	Ratio of the decision
The Labour Appellate Tribunal also overlooked the fact that but for the Public Companies (Limitation of Dividend	Ratio of the decision
Ordinance of 1948 the whole of the profits of 1948 could have been distributed after paying the workers bonus in that year of four annas in the rupee	Ratio of the decision
We may before concluding refer to an argument which was addressed to us by Mr. Isaacs, the learned counsel for the respondent, that this Court under article 136 should not interfere with the decisions of the tribunals set up by the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947	Ratio of the decision
This contention can be shortly answered by referring to our decision in Bharat Bank Ltd., Delhi v. Employees of the Bharat Bank Ltd., Delhi, (1950] S.C.R. 459 1950 Indlaw SC 48; where we held that the Industrial Tribunals were tribunals within the meaning of article 136 and further that article 136 has vested in this, Court exceptional and overriding power to interfere where it reaches the conclusion that a person has been dealt with arbitrarily or that a Court or tribunal within the territory of India has not given a fair deal to a litigant	Ratio of the decision
Vide Dhakeswari Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal 1954 Indlaw SC 213	Ratio of the decision
The result therefore is that the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal appealed against must be reversed and that of the Industrial Court (Textiles and Hosiery), Kanpur, restored	Ruling by Present Court
The appeal will accordingly be allowed with costs	Ruling by Present Court
Appeal allowed	Ruling by Present Court
