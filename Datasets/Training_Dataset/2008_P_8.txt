Allegedly,on the premise that the first respondent is the proprietor of the said mark by reason of long user and,thus,acquired a reputation in that behalf,a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963	Facts

The said M/s	Facts
Jain Industries,however,was not impleaded as a party therein	Facts
The cause of action therefor was stated to have arisen in the following circumstances : "That the cause of action for the present petition arose in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents in the month of January 1987 when the respondent informed this Hon'ble Court that they have been recorded as subsequent proprietors of the impugned registered trade mark No.228867 in Class 7 in C.O.No.9 of 1986,whereupon the petitioner withdrew the said earlier petition C.O.No.9 of 1986 with permission of the court to file the present petition,because of the changed circumstances	Facts

A learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court,however,refused to stay the operation of the order of the Board dated 27.10.2004.An appeal was preferred there against	Facts
The Division Bench of the High Court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the Letters Patent Appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the Board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits	Facts
The said order of the Division Bench is under challenge in this appeal	Facts
The core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case,the application under S.46(1)(b) was maintainable	Ratio of the decision
Before adverting thereto,we may take notice of the relevant statutory provisions : Ss.46(1)(b),48(1),48(2) and 56 read as under: "Section 46--Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-use--(1) Subject to the provisions of section 47,a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either-- (a	Statute
b) that up to a date one month before the date of the application,a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being: Provided that,except where the applicant has been permitted under sub-s.(3) of s.12 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark,the tribunal may refuse an application u/cl.(a) or cl.(b) in relation to any goods,if it is shown that there has been,before the relevent date or during the relevant period,as the case may be,bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to goods of the same description,being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered	Statute
Section 48--Registered users--(1) Subject to the provisions of section 49,a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as the registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trademark is registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark; but the Central Government may,by rules made in this behalf,provide that no application for registration as such shall be enertained unless the agreement between the parties complies with the conditions laid down in the rules for preventing trafficking in trade marks	Statute
The permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof,and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other than the proprietor,for the purposes of s.46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under this Act or any other law	Statute
Section 56--Power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register--(1	Statute
On application made in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved,the tribunal may make such order as it may think fit for cancelling or varying the registration of a trade mark on the ground of any contravention,or failure to observe a condition entered on the register in relation thereto	Statute
Any person aggrieved by the absence or omission from the register of any entry,or by any entry made in the register without sufficient cause,or by any entry wrongly remaining on the register,or by any error of defect in any entry in the ' register,may apply in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar,and the tribunal may make such order for making,expunging or varying the entry as it may think fit	Statute
The tribunal may in any proceeding under this section decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide in connection with the rectification of the register	Statute
The tribunal,of its own motion,may,after giving notice in the prescribed manner to the parties concerned and after giving them an opportunity of being heard,make any order referred to in sub-s.(1) or sub-s.(2	Statute
Any order of the High Court rectifying the register shall direct that notice of the rectification shall be served upon the Registrar in the prescribed manner who shall upon receipt of such notice rectify the register accordingly	Statute
The power to rectify the register conferred by this section shall include the power to remove a trade mark registered in Part A of the register to Part B of the register	Statute
Indisputably,the scope of the provisions for removal from Register in terms of S.46 and 56 of the Act stand on different footings	Ratio of the decision
Whereas S.46 had a limited application,S.56 of the Act is wider in nature	Ratio of the decision
Concededly,cl.(a) of sub-s.(1) of S.46 is not attracted in the case	Ratio of the decision
For the purpose of appreciation of the rival contentions,we may notice the findings of the Board as also the High Court	Facts
The Board has taken the view that the period of five years and one month will begin to run from the date on which Thukral became the proprietor of the trademark,that is,30th May,1986 and,therefore,the rectification application could have been filed by the appellant only sometime in 1991.Opining that an application for rectification against the appellant within a period of seven and a half months from the date of assignment of the trade mark was not maintainable,the application was dismissed	Facts
The High Court on the other hand opined: "It was not anybody's case before us that M/s Jain Industries	Facts
the registered proprietor of the trademark used it at all	Facts
The trademark was used by the Appellant and Thukral,neither of whom were proprietors thereof,except that Thukral claims to have become its proprietor with effect from 30th May,1986.According to learned counsel for the Appellant,the use of the trademark by Thukral was not legally permissible use inasmuch as Thukral did not have the consent,tacit or otherwise of M/s	Facts
Jain Industries to use the trademark	Facts
If Thukral did,then it cannot be said that there was no bona fide use thereof by its proprietor	Facts
that is,M/s Jain Industries	Facts
This appears to be the position at least till 30th May,1986.In	Facts
the meantime,as a result of the ex parte ad interim injunction granted on 19th December 1985 by this Court in Suit No.2408 of 1985,there was no question of Thukral using the trademark Field Marshal till the injunction was vacated on 19th January,1988	Facts
The Act was enacted to provide for the registration and better protection of trademarks and for the prevention of the use of fraudulent marks of merchandise	Ratio of the decision
Registration of a trade mark remains valid for seven years	Ratio of the decision
Renewal applications are required to be filed on the expiry of seven years	Ratio of the decision
M/s	Ratio of the decision
Jain Industries got itself registered and obtained periodical renewal thereof as is required under the Act	Ratio of the decision
First Respondent withdrew the application against M/s	Ratio of the decision
Jain Industries	Ratio of the decision
The prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps (goods) so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned	Ratio of the decision
It is in the aforementioned situation,we are called upon to determine the meaning of the words 'for the time being' occurring in S.46(1)(b) of the Act	Ratio of the decision
Two interpretations thereto which are possible are: (1) the said words would denote non-use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer; and (2) The mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor	Ratio of the decision
We may,however,also notice that another construction of the said provision has been put forth by Mr	Ratio of the decision
Sunderam,learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant,that the word 'proprietor' would not mean a registered proprietor but also a person who has become 'proprietor' by long use thereof	Ratio of the decision
The words 'for the time being' would mean differently in different situations	Ratio of the decision
It may mean 'the moment or existing position' as was held by this Court in the case of Jivendra Nath Kaul v	Precedent
Collector/District Magistrate and Anr.[(1992	Precedent
3 SCC 576 1992 Indlaw SC 1107] or in the context of cl.(22) of Art.366 of the Constitution as has been held in H.H.Maharajadhiraja	Precedent
Madhav Rao Jivaji Rao Scindia Bahadur of Gwalior,H.H.Maharajadhiraja	Precedent
Maharana Shri Bhagwat Singhji Bahadur of Udaipur v	Precedent
Union of India and Anr.,AIR 1971	Precedent
SC 530 1970 Indlaw SC 300 para 88  to mean: "By the use of the expression "for the time being" in Cl.(22) of Art.366	Precedent
the President is not invested with authority to accord a temporary recognition to a Ruler nor with authority to recognize or not to recognize a Ruler arbitrarily : the expression "for them time being" predicts that there shall be a Ruler of the Indian State,that if the first recognized Ruler dies,or ceases to be a Ruler,a successor shall be appointed,and that there shall not be more Rulers than one at a given time	Precedent
The terms also may bring within its umbrage the entire period of five years or more irrespective of the fact as to whether the registered proprietor was one or more than one as has been held by the High Court	Ratio of the decision
There cannot be any doubt or dispute that the registration of a trade mark confers a very valuable right	Ratio of the decision
The person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner	Ratio of the decision
It confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered	Ratio of the decision
The same is an assignable right in terms of S.36 of the Act,whereas an unregistered trade mark is not	Ratio of the decision
Non	Ratio of the decision
user of the said mark,therefore,entails the consequences laid down under cl.(b) of Sub-s.(1) of S.46	Ratio of the decision
However,such an application can be filed only by a person aggrieved	Ratio of the decision
When the applicant before the Board establishes the fact in regard to non-user of the mark for a period of more than five years on the part of the registered owner,the latter may show that his case falls within the purview of sub-s.(3) of S.46	Ratio of the decision
The question which,therefore,arises is as to who can prove that he had the bona fide intention to use the trade mark on the date of application for registration	Ratio of the decision
Indisputably,it would be the registered proprietor	Ratio of the decision
S.46 is a penal provision	Ratio of the decision
It provides for civil or evil consequences	Ratio of the decision
It takes away the valuable right of a registered proprietor	Ratio of the decision
It,therefore,can be taken away only when the conditions laid down therefor are satisfied	Ratio of the decision
While we say so,we are not oblivious of the fact that trafficking in trade mark is to be discouraged	Ratio of the decision
A registered proprietor of a trade mark should not be permitted to circumvent the law of user of the trade mark for a long time by assigning the same from time to time	Ratio of the decision
But then such a case has to be made out	Ratio of the decision
Allegation of trafficking is a serious one	Ratio of the decision
It must be proved in presence of the person against whom such allegations are made	Ratio of the decision
At the time of grant of original registration,advertisements are issued and objections are called for	Ratio of the decision
Renewal of registration,in a sense,also is not automatic	Ratio of the decision
A person who had been using the said trade mark as a proprietor thereof by user is supposed to keep itself abreast with such applications filed by another either for registration of the trade mark or renewal thereof	Ratio of the decision
The non-user for a long time would disentitle a registered proprietor from renewal of the registration	Ratio of the decision
It must not,however,be forgotten that S.46(1)(b) provides for a special remedy	Ratio of the decision
As a person obtains a right on and from the date of registration and/or renewal thereof,he can ordinarily be deprived of his right unless it is shown that the assignment thereof by his holder was not a bona fide one or had been made by way of camouflage	Ratio of the decision
If the assignee has obtained assignment for bona fide use,he may not be fastened with any liability owing to non-user on the part of his predecessor	Ratio of the decision
In other words,the mistake of the predecessor should not be visited with non-use of the present registered owner	Ratio of the decision
It must,however,be observed that whether a use is for bona fide purpose would essentially be a question of fact	Ratio of the decision
Whether S.46(1)(b) read with S.48 of the Act would bring within its purview,not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case	Ratio of the decision
In Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba v	Precedent
Tosiba Appliances Co	Precedent
Ors.[(2008) 8 SCALE 354 2008 Indlaw SC 1395],this Court held : "We do not find any force in the aforementioned submission	Precedent
Cls.(a) and (b) operate in different fileds	Precedent
Sub-s.(3) covers a case falling within cl.(b) and not the cl.(a) thereof	Precedent
Had the intention of the Parliament been that sub-s.(3) covers cases falling under cl.(b) and clause (a),having regard to the similarity of the expressions used,there was no reason as to why it could not be stated so explicitly	Precedent
It was furthermore opined : "There may be a case where owing to certain special circumstances,a continuous use is not possible	Precedent
The trade mark for which registration is obtained is used intermittently	Precedent
Such non-user for a temporary period may be due to any exigency including a bar under a statute,or a policy decision of the Government or any action taken against the registrant	Precedent
It was observed that in cases of intermittent use also,cl.(b) shall apply	Precedent

V.Addisons Paint & Chemicals Ltd.[(2003) 11 SCC 92 2003 Indlaw SC 756]: "In our opinion,the phrase "person aggrieved" for the purposes of removal on the ground of non-use under S.46 has a different connotation from the phrase used in s.56 for canceling or expunging or varying an entry wrongly made or remaining in the Register	Precedent
The submission of Mr	Ratio of the decision
Sudhir Chandra	Ratio of the decision
that the appellant was an infringer both of the right of M/s	Ratio of the decision
Jain Industries as also the first respondent and,thus,its use was not bona fide in a case of this nature cannot be accepted	Ratio of the decision
If appellant infringed the right of M/s	Ratio of the decision
Jain Industries,it was for it to take action there for	Ratio of the decision
It did not	Ratio of the decision
First respondent itself accepts that at least immediately prior to the institution of the suit,appellant had been using the same	Ratio of the decision
We are not concerned herein as to since when it had been doing so	Ratio of the decision
It obtained an or of injunction	Ratio of the decision
The order of injunction was vacated	Ratio of the decision
For one reason or the other,the said order attained finality	Ratio of the decision
Prima facie,therefore,appellant has been held to be the registered owner of the trade mark	Ratio of the decision
It is one thing to say that for the purpose of frustrating an application for rectification,the appellant had colluded with its predecessor for the purpose of trafficking by entering into the deed of assignment which is otherwise illegal and bad in law	Ratio of the decision
but it is another thing to say that the appellant could be proceeded against alone for non-user of the registered trade mark for a period of more than five years	Ratio of the decision
For the purpose of making out such a case,both the original registrants as also the assignee were required to be impleaded as parties	Ratio of the decision
We may,at this stage,notice that in Law of Trade Marks by Mr	Ratio of the decision
K.C.Kailasam,while commenting on S.47 of the Trade Marks Act,1999 to which our attention has been drawn by Mr	Ratio of the decision
Sudhir Chandra,it is stated	Ratio of the decision
Notes on clauses	Ratio of the decision
This clause corresponds to s.46 of the existing Act and provides for removal of a trade mark from the register on the ground of non-use	Ratio of the decision
A trade mark which is not used within five years of its registration,becomes liable for removal either completely or in respect of those goods or services for which the mark has not been used	Ratio of the decision
Under S.46(1),it is proposed to clarify that the five years period will start from the date on which the trade mark is actually entered on the register	Ratio of the decision
This amendment is intended to remove any ambiguity,as for all other purposes,the date of registration will be the date on which the application was filed vide cl.23(2).Proviso to sub-cl.(1) also provides that the tribunal may refuse removal of the mark if it is shown that any proprietor had in fact made bona fide use of the trademark for goods or services of the same description or associated goods or services	Ratio of the decision
It is also proposed to increase the period from 1 to 3 months in cl.47(1)(a) and (b) in which use of the trade mark,prior to the date of filing of the application for removal of the trade mark,shall be disregarded	Ratio of the decision
This is intended to prevent the registered proprietor to by pass the Act by such token use after he comes to know that an application for removal is about to be filed.?Sub-cl.(3) protects a mark from being removed from the register on ground of non-use if such non-use is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade	Ratio of the decision
The clause is proposed to be modified to clarify that special circumstances in the trade will include restrictions imposed by any law or regulation on the use of trade mark in India	Ratio of the decision
Consequential amendments have been made to cover services.(Cl.47 of the Bill	Ratio of the decision
The Court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof	Ratio of the decision
It seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment	Ratio of the decision
Thus,a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out	Ratio of the decision
Such an application may be maintainable in terms of S.56 of the Act but strictly not in terms of S.46(1)(b) thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor	Ratio of the decision
We are not satisfied with the explanation offered by the first respondent that it gave up the case of non-use of the registered trade mark against M/s Jain Industries on the basis of statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant; firstly because consent does not confer jurisdiction; secondly,because want and/or lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Tribunal cannot be waived as if any order is passed without jurisdiction,the same would be a nullity; and thirdly because the cause of action,even according to the first respondent in his application before the High Court,was different	Ratio of the decision
The counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant did not state that it had waived its right so far as non-impleadment of M/s	Ratio of the decision
Jain Industries was concerned	Ratio of the decision
It only consented for grant of liberty in favour of the first respondent for filing of an application for the self-same cause of action	Ratio of the decision
The question of maintainability of the second suit is absence of the registrant proprietor was not and could not have been the subject matter of consent at that stage	Ratio of the decision
The cause of action which permitted the first respondent to file an application for rectification against M/s	Ratio of the decision
Jain Industries was non-user thereof by it	Ratio of the decision
Its non-user and rectification of the register could not,in the aforementioned situation,have been tagged with the cause of action,if any,against the appellant	Ratio of the decision
The second contention of Mr	Ratio of the decision
that the appellant was an infringer of the trade mark is again a question of fact	Ratio of the decision
The right of the first respondent as a proprietor of the trade mark by reason of a long user is required to be determined vis-'-vis M/s	Ratio of the decision
Jain Industries as also the appellant in the suit filed by it which is pending	Ratio of the decision
The Board could not,while exercising its jurisdiction under S.46(1)(b),of the Act proceeded on the basis of such presumption	Ratio of the decision
It is not correct that no cause of action survived against Jain Industries	Ratio of the decision
It was not lost by reason of assignment as was contended by the learned counsel	Ratio of the decision
In the suit,only the competing right of the first respondent qua the appellant can be determined and not a right against M/s	Ratio of the decision
Such a right cannot be determined in a proceeding under S.46(1)(b) of the Act which is restricted to non-user of the registered trade mark	Ratio of the decision
Both the appellant and the respondent No.1 were the infringers of the right of M/s	Ratio of the decision
Jain Industries as it was the registered proprietor of the trade mark in respect of the goods in question,namely,centrifugal pumps	Ratio of the decision
Two interpretations of the said provision S.46(1)(b) are possible	Ratio of the decision
While interpreting the same,however,certain basic principles of construction of statute must be kept in mind	Ratio of the decision
As it takes away somebody's right,it deserves strict construction	Ratio of the decision
Jurisdiction of the Board being dependent on determination of the foundational facts,the same was required to be established on the basis of the averments made in the application and not otherwise	Ratio of the decision
The right of a registered trade mark is not lost automatically on the expiry of five years and one month	Ratio of the decision
It does not provide for a 'sun set' law	Ratio of the decision
It has to be adjudicated upon	Ratio of the decision
Whether the registered proprietor of the trade mark had taken recourse to trafficking or not must be determined in an appropriate proceeding	Ratio of the decision
The principle of 'purchaser of a property has a duty to make enquiries',therefore,cannot apply in a case of this nature	Ratio of the decision
So long as the right to assign a registered trade mark remains valid,once the same is validly assigned,the assignee derives the same right as that of the assignor in terms of the statute	Ratio of the decision
A title to a trade mark derived on assignment as provided for under the Act cannot be equated with a defective title acquired in any other property as admittedly on the date of assignment,the right of the registered trade mark was not extinguished	Ratio of the decision
Both the findings of the High Court which we have noticed hereinbefore are findings on question of law and in that view of the matter the contention of Mr	Ratio of the decision
Sudhir Chandra that the merit of the matter is yet to be gone into by the Board cannot be a ground for ignoring the submissions made at the bar	Ratio of the decision
Our attention has again been drawn to a passage from 'Law of Trade marks & Geographical Indications' by Shri K.C.Kailasam,wherein the judgment of the Tribunal has been criticized in the following terms : "From the above legislative intent,it would seem that the period of non-use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration	Ratio of the decision
In the case of American Home Products Corporation v	Ratio of the decision
Mac Laboratories Pvt.Ltd	Ratio of the decision
Rendered under the 1958 Act,it was held by the Supreme Court that "the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove	Ratio of the decision
such continuous non-user." It would appear that neither the U.K.Act,nor the Indian Act,at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non-use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark,so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration,every-time there is change in the ownership of the mark	Ratio of the decision
If that be so,any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s.47(1)(a) and (b).Further,it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to "the provisions of the Act and any rights vested in any other person" -See	Ratio of the decision
