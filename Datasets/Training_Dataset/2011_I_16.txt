On 14.11.1997,a trap was laid by the CBI officials along with panchas and when the accused demanded and accepted a sum of Rs.200/-as illegal gratification,he was caught red handed along with the money which was recovered from the right hand side pocket of his pant	Facts
e	Ratio of the decision
On 15.11.1997,at 7.30 a.m.,an FIR was registered by the Inspector,CBI,Visakhapatnam Branch in Crime No.RC 20(A)/97-VSP.After recording the statements of the witnesses,Inspector of Police,CBI,Visakhapatnam filed charge sheet being No.2/98-YTR dated 29.04.1998 against the appellant-accused for an offence punishable under Sections 7,13(1)(d)(ii) read with S.13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act,1988 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") in the Court of Special Judge for CBI Cases at Visakhapatnam	Facts

Heard Mr	Facts
ATM Rangaramanujam,learned senior counsel for the appellant and Mr	Facts
Harish Chandra,learned senior counsel for the respondent	Facts
Notice only on quantum of sentence-hearing on all aspects	Facts
Permissibility	Ratio of the decision
On 28.01.2008,this Court consisting of three Hon'ble Judges issued notice in this matter confining to the quantum of sentence only	Facts
In pursuance of the same,we permitted Mr	Facts
Rangaramanujam,learned senior counsel for the appellant to address his arguments confining to quantum of sentence imposed on the appellant-accused	Facts
As stated in the narration of facts,the appellant was convicted u/s.7 of the Act for which he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-,in default,simple imprisonment for one month	Facts
He was also convicted for the offence under S.13(1)(d)(ii) read with S.13(2) of the Act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and fine of Rs.500/-,in default,simple imprisonment for one month	Facts
The trial Court ordered that both the sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently	Facts
The said conviction and sentence was affirmed by the High Court	Facts
If we confine ourselves to the limited extent of notice dated 28.01.2008,we have to hear both sides only on the quantum of sentence	Facts
However,Mr.Rangaramanujam,learned senior counsel for the appellant by drawing our attention to the recent judgment of this Court in Yomeshbhai Pranshankar Bhatt vs	Argument
State of Gujarat,(2011) 6 SCC 312 2011 Indlaw SC 370,submitted that in spite of limited notice,this Court,while exercising jurisdiction u/art.142 of the Constitution,in order to do complete justice while hearing the matter finally can go into the merits of the orders passed by the trial Court and the High Court	Argument
In the reported case,the appeal was against the concurrent finding of both the courts convicting the appellant u/s.302 IPC and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment for life	Argument
At the SLP stage,this Court,by order dated 27.07.2009,issued notice confined only to the question as to whether the petitioner was guilty of commission of an offence under any of the parts of S.304 Indian Penal Code,1860 (in short 'IPC') and not u/s.302 IPC.Similar request was made before the Bench that the appellant was entitled to urge all the questions including his right to urge that he should have been acquitted in the facts and circumstances of the case	Argument
This Court,referred to the Supreme Court Rules,1966 which have been framed u/art.145 of the Constitution and also considered scope of its power u/art.142 as well as Order 47	Argument
Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908	Argument
in short 'the Code).While deciding the said question,the Bench has also considered the scope of S.100 of the Code for entertaining the second appeal	Argument
It further shows that the Court considered the plea of the appellant therein for acquittal despite the fact that the notice was limited in terms of the order dated 27.07.2009.It is relevant to point out that the Bench in para 18,clarified the position and reopened the case in its entirety even though notice was issued confining to a particular aspect	Argument
After permitting the appellant therein to argue the case for acquittal on merits,it observed: " .......We,however,make it clear that this cannot be a universal practice in all cases	Argument
The question whether the Court will enlarge the scope of its inquiry at the time of final hearing depends on the facts and circumstances of the case	Argument
Since in the facts of this case,we find that the appellant should be heard on all points,we have come to the aforesaid conclusion	Argument
Emphasis supplied	Statute
It is clear that the Bench itself has clarified that they are not laying down the law that in spite of issuing notice confining to a particular aspect (in the case on hand -"quantum of sentence") the parties are entitled to urge all points and re-open the case as if they are free to do the same without any restriction	Ratio of the decision
As a matter of fact,the last sentence in para 18 makes it clear that in the facts and circumstances of that case,they permitted the appellants to urge all points on merits	Ratio of the decision
In the case on hand,it is to be noted that on appreciation of oral and documentary evidence led in by the prosecution and the defence and on appreciation of entire materials,the court of first instance i.e.the trial Court convicted the appellant and sentenced him as mentioned above	Ratio of the decision
The High Court,as an appellate Court,once again analysed all the material,discussed the oral and documentary evidence and finding that the prosecution had proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt concurred with the conclusion arrived at by the trial Court and dismissed the appeal of the appellant	Ratio of the decision
Inasmuch as both the courts have thoroughly discussed the oral and documentary evidence with reference to the charges leveled against the appellant and in view of the limited order dated 28.01.2008 by this Court issuing notice confining to quantum of sentence only and even applying the analogy enunciated in Yomeshbhai 2011 Indlaw SC 370 (supra),we feel that it is not a case of such nature that the appellant should be heard on all points,consequently,we reject the request of the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant	Ratio of the decision
Quantum of sentence	Ratio of the decision
Whether requires any reduction	Ratio of the decision
Mr	Argument
Rangaramanujam,learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that inasmuch as the alleged incident took place on 14.11.1997 and 14 years have elapsed since then,the amount of Rs.200/-said to have been received by the appellant is trivial in nature and also of the fact that due to the said conviction and sentence he lost his job,leniency may be shown and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone	Argument
He fairly admitted that out of the maximum period of one year,the appellant had served only 52 days in prison	Argument
With this factual position,let us consider whether the request of the learned senior counsel for the appellant is to be accepted and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone	Argument
It is not in dispute that the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act,1988 alone are applicable since the incident occurred on 14.11.1997 i.e.subsequent to the Act	Ratio of the decision
S.7 of the Act relates to public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act	Ratio of the decision
If the said offence/charge is proved,the court has no other option but to impose sentence of imprisonment which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and also liable to fine	Ratio of the decision
The said section reads as under:- " Public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act.-Whoever,being,or expecting to be a public servant,accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person,for himself or for any other person,any gratification whatever,other than legal remuneration,as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or for showing or forbearing to show,in the exercise of his official functions,favour or disfavor to any person or for rendering or attempting to render any service or disservice to any person,with the Central Government or any State Government or Parliament or the Legislature of any State or with any local authority,corporation or Government company referred to in Cl.(c) of Section 2,or with any public servant,whether named or otherwise shall,be punishable with imprisonment which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine........." (Emphasis supplied	Statute
S.13 deals with criminal misconduct by a public servant	Statute
As per sub-s.(2) if any public servant commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine	Statute
For clarity,we reproduce the said section hereunder: " Criminal misconduct by a public servant.-(1	Statute
A public servant is said to commit the offence of criminal misconduct, (a) If he habitually accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person for himself or for any other person any gratification other than legal remuneration as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in Section 7; or (b) If he habitually accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain for himself or for any other person,any valuable thing without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate from any person whom he knows to have been,or to be,or to be likely to he concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by him or having any connection with the official functions of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate,or from any,person whom he knows to be interests in or related to the person so concerned; or (c	Statute
If he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriates or otherwise converts for his own use any property entrusted to him or under his control as a public servant or allows any other person so to do; or (d	Statute
If he,- (i	Statute
By corrupt or illegal means,obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or Pecuniary advantage; or (ii) By abusing his position as a public servant,obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage; or (iii	Statute
While holding office as a public servant,obtains for any person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage without any public interest; or (e) If he or any person on his behalf,is in possession or has,at any time during the Period of his office,been in possession for which the public servant cannot satisfactorily account,of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his known sources of income	Statute
Explanation	Statute
For the purposes of this section "known sources of income" means income received from any lawful source and such receipt has been intimated in accordance,with the provisions of any law,rules or orders for the time being applicable to public servant	Statute
Any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine	Statute
It is useful to refer that in the Prevention of Corruption Act,1947 the same "criminal misconduct" which is available in S.13 of the 1988 Act had been dealt with in S.5 of the 1947 Act	Statute
S.5(2) of the 1947 Act mandates that any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine	Statute
However,proviso to sub-s.(2) of S.5 gives power to the court that for any special reasons to be recorded in writing,impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than one year	Statute
Such relaxation in the form of a proviso has been done away with in the 1988 Act	Statute
To put it clear,in the 1988 Act,if an offence u/s.7 is proved,the same is punishable with imprisonment which shall be not less than six months and in the case of Section 13,it shall not be less than one year	Statute
No other interpretation is permissible	Statute
Other circumstances pleaded for reduction of sentence	Ratio of the decision
In order to substantiate the claim with the regard to the above,learned senior counsel for the appellant has relied on the decision of this Court in Bechaarbhai S.Prajapati vs	Argument
State of Gujarat,(2008) 11 SCC 163 2008 Indlaw SC 297 and based on the same requested this Court to modify the sentence to the extent of period already undergone	Argument
We have gone through the facts in that case	Ratio of the decision
It is true that even in the cited decision,the appellant accused demanded only Rs.250/-and it was paid and accepted	Ratio of the decision
Finally,the Special Judge framed charges for offence punishable under Sections 7,12,13(1)(d) read with S.13(2) of the Act	Ratio of the decision
The appellant therein was convicted for offence u/s.7(2) of the Act and appeal before the High Court was also dismissed	Ratio of the decision
Thereafter,the same was challenged before this Court	Ratio of the decision
This Court,after holding that the conclusion of the trial Court and High Court does not suffer from any infirmity considered the alternative submission which related to harshness of sentence	Ratio of the decision
In that case,taking note of the fact that the occurrence took place nearly seven years back and also of the fact that the appellant had suffered custody for more than six months,considering all these aspects,while maintaining the conviction,this Court reduced the sentence to the period already undergone	Ratio of the decision
Since the appellant therein was convicted only u/s.7 and S.161 Cr	Ratio of the decision
PC.,the minimum sentence being six months and of the fact that he had suffered custody for more than six months,the course adopted by this Court is perfectly in order and the same cannot be applied to the case on hand,wherein the appellant had undergone only 52 days when the minimum sentence was six months u/s.7 and one year u/s.13	Ratio of the decision
Learned senior counsel for the appellant further submitted that inasmuch as the incident had occurred on 14.11.1997 and the trial Court has convicted him on 19.03.2001 which was affirmed by the High Court on 03.10.2007,at this juncture,i.e.,after a gap of 14 years,there is no need to retain the same sentence and the Court is not justified in directing the appellant to serve the remaining period after such a long time	Argument
There is no dispute as regards the date of occurrence and the date of conviction passed by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court	Ratio of the decision
Inasmuch as the conviction on both counts have been confirmed by this Court and we are confined to sentence part alone and in view of the minimum sentence prescribed u/ss.7 and 13 of the Act,we are of the view that though long delay may be a ground for reduction of sentence in other cases,the same may not be applicable to the case on hand when the statute prescribes minimum sentence	Ratio of the decision
Accordingly,we reject the said contention	Ratio of the decision
It was further contended that the amount alleged to have been received by the appellant accused is only Rs.200/-and he also lost his job after conviction by the trial court	Argument
Though,these grounds may be attractive in respect of other offences where minimum sentence is not prescribed,in view of our reasonings in the earlier paras,the same cannot be applied to the case on hand	Ratio of the decision
About the request based on delay that the appellant has lost his job,undergone the ordeal all along etc.a lenient view be taken in this case,it is useful to refer decision of this Court in State of M.P.vs	Precedent
Shambhu Dayal	Precedent
Nagar,(2006) 8 SCC 693 2006	Precedent
Indlaw SC 716 wherein it was held that: " It is difficult to accept the prayer of the respondent that a lenient view be taken in this case	Precedent
The corruption by public servants has become a gigantic problem	Precedent
It has spread everywhere	Precedent
No facet of public activity has been left unaffected by the stink of corruption	Precedent
It has deep and pervasive impact on the functioning of the entire country	Precedent
Large-scale corruption retards the nation-building activities and everyone has to suffer on that count	Precedent
As has been aptly observed in Swatantar Singh v	Precedent
State of Haryana,(1997) 4 SCC 14 1997 Indlaw SC 1061,corruption is corroding,like cancerous lymph nodes,the vital veins of the body politics,social fabric of efficiency in the public service and demoralising the honest officers	Precedent
The efficiency in public service would improve only when the public servant devotes his sincere attention and does the duty diligently,truthfully,honestly and devotes himself assiduously to the performance of the duties of his post	Precedent
The reputation of corrupt would gather thick and unchaseable clouds around the conduct of the officer and gain notoriety much faster than the smoke	Precedent
Art.142 and its applicability	Precedent
By drawing our attention to Art.142 of the Constitution of India,learned senior counsel for the appellant vehemently submitted that in order to do complete justice,this Court has ample power to reduce the sentence even to the extent of period already undergone or any other order which would be beneficial to the parties approaching this Court	Argument
Similar claim based on Art.142 has been negatived in several decisions by this Court,we need to refer only the latest decision of this Court in Manish Goel vs	Precedent
Rohini Goel,(2010) 4 SCC 393 2010 Indlaw SC 301.The facts in that case are that the parties by persuasion of the family members and friends,entered into a compromise and prepared a memorandum of understanding dated 13.11.2009,in the proceedings pending before the Mediation Centre,Delhi,by which they agreed on terms and conditions incorporated therein,to settle all their disputes and also for dissolution of their marriage	Precedent
The parties filed an application under Section 13-B(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 before the Family Court,Delhi seeking divorce by mutual consent	Precedent
The said HMA No.456 of 2009 came before the court and it recorded the statement of parties on 16.11.2009.The parties moved another HMA No.457 of 2009 to waive the statutory period of six months in filing the second petition	Precedent
However,the court rejected the said application vide order dated 01.12.2009 observing that the court was not competent to waive the required statutory period of six months under the Act and such a waiver was permissible only under the directions of the Supreme Court as held by this Court in Anil Kumar Jain vs	Precedent
Maya Jain,(2009	Precedent
10 SCC 415 2009 Indlaw SC 1494.Hence the parties have approached this Court for appropriate relief	Precedent
Speaking for the Bench one of us -(Dr	Precedent
Justice B.S.Chauhan) referred to more than fifty decisions including the Constitution Bench judgments	Precedent
The relevant paras,which are useful,may be quoted: " We are fully alive of the fact that this Court has been exercising the power u/art.142 of the Constitution for dissolution of marriage where the Court finds that marriage is totally unworkable,emotionally dead,beyond salvage and has broken down irretrievably,even if the facts of the case do not provide a ground in law on which the divorce could be granted	Precedent
Decree of divorce has been granted to put quietus to all litigations between the parties and to save them from further agony,as it is evident from the judgments in Romesh Chander v	Precedent

In Anjana Kishore v	Precedent
Puneet Kishore (2002) 10 SCC 194 2001 Indlaw SC 21204,this Court while allowing a transfer petition directed the court concerned to decide the case of divorce by mutual consent,ignoring the statutory requirement of moving the motion after expiry of the period of six months under Section 13-B(2) of the Act	Precedent
In Anil Kumar Jain,this Court held that an order of waiving the statutory requirements can be passed only by this Court in exercise of its powers u/art.142 of the Constitution	Precedent
The said power is not vested with any other court	Precedent
However,we have also noticed various judgments of this Court taking a contrary view to the effect that in case the legal ground for grant of divorce is missing,exercising such power tantamounts to legislation and thus transgression of the powers of the legislature,which is not permissible in law (vide Chetan Dass v	Precedent

Generally,no court has competence to issue a direction contrary to law nor can the court direct an authority to act in contravention of the statutory provisions	Precedent
The courts are meant to enforce the rule of law and not to pass the orders or directions which are contrary to what has been injected by law.(Vide State of Punjab v	Precedent

Behrose Darab Madan (2009) 10 SCC 425 2009 Indlaw SC 1154,while dealing with the provisions of Art.142 of the Constitution,this Court has held as under:	Precedent
The power u/art.142 of the Constitution is a constitutional power and hence,not restricted by statutory enactments	Precedent
Though the Supreme Court would not pass any order u/art.142 of the Constitution which would amount to supplanting substantive law applicable or ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with the subject,at the same time these constitutional powers cannot in any way,be controlled by any statutory provisions	Precedent
However,it is to be made clear that this power cannot be used to supplant the law applicable to the case	Precedent
This means that acting under Article 142,the Supreme Court cannot pass an order or grant relief which is totally inconsistent or goes against the substantive or statutory enactments pertaining to the case	Precedent
The power is to be used sparingly in cases which cannot be effectively and appropriately tackled by the existing provisions of law or when the existing provisions of law cannot bring about complete justice between the parties	Precedent
Emphasis added	Precedent
After elaborately discussing almost all the case laws on this subject about jurisdiction of this Court under Article 142,summarised the same in the following words: Therefore,the law in this regard can be summarised to the effect that in exercise of the power u/art.142 of the Constitution,this Court generally does not pass an order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor is the power exercised merely on sympathy	Ratio of the decision

In Supreme Court Bar Association v	Precedent
Union of India: 1998 (4) SCC 409	Precedent
1998 Indlaw SC 688,this Court observed: The Supreme Court in exercise of its jurisdiction u/art.142 has the power to make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice "between the parties in any cause or matter pending before it".The very nature of the power must lead the court to set limits for itself within which to exercise those powers and ordinarily it cannot disregard a statutory provision governing a subject,except perhaps to balance the equities between the conflicting claims of the litigating parties by "ironing out the creases" in a cause or matter before it	Precedent
Indeed this Court is not a court of restricted jurisdiction of only dispute settling	Precedent
It is well recognised and established that this Court has always been a law maker and its role travels beyond merely dispute settling	Precedent
It is a "problem solver in the nebulous areas".(See	Precedent
K.Veeraswami v	Precedent
Union of India : 1991 (3) SCC 655 1991 Indlaw SC	Precedent
711,but the substantive statutory provisions dealing with the subject matter of a given case,cannot be altogether ignored by this Court,while making an order u/art.142.Indeed,these constitutional powers can not,in any way,be controlled by any statutory provisions but at the same time these powers are not meant to be exercised when their exercise may come directly in conflict with what has been expressly provided for in statute dealing expressly with the subject	Precedent
In Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v	Precedent
Rajesh Ranjan : 2005 (3	Precedent
SCC 284 2005 Indlaw SC 93,this Court after reiterating that this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction u/art.142 of the Constitution would not pass any order which would amount to supplanting substantive law applicable to the case or ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with the subject,observed as follows	Precedent
It may therefore be understood that the plenary powers of this Court u/art.142 of the Constitution are inherent in the Court and are complementary to those powers which are specifically conferred on the Court by various statutes though are not limited by those statutes .These	Precedent
powers also exist independent of the statutes with a view to do complete justice between the parties...and are in the nature of supplementary powers	Precedent
and] may be put on a different and perhaps even wider footing than ordinary inherent powers of a court to prevent injustice	Precedent
The advantage that is derived from a constitutional provision couched in such a wide compass is that it prevents 'clogging or obstruction of the stream of justice	Precedent
See: Supreme Court Bar Association 1998 Indlaw SC 688 (supra	Precedent
Though the jurisdiction of this Court,u/art.142 of the Constitution of India is not in dispute,we make it clear that exercise of such power would,however,depend on the facts and circumstances of each case	Ratio of the decision
The High Court,in exercise of its jurisdiction,u/s.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code and this Court	Ratio of the decision
u/art.142 of the Constitution,would not ordinarily direct quashing of a case involving crime against the society particularly	Ratio of the decision
when both the trial Court as also the High Court have found that the charge leveled against the appellant under the Act has been made out and proved by the prosecution by placing acceptable evidence	Ratio of the decision
Finally,learned senior counsel for the appellant has cited certain orders of this Court wherein this Court has reduced the period of sentence already undergone while upholding the conviction	Argument
We have perused those orders	Ratio of the decision
The orders do not disclose any factual details and the relevant provisions under which the accused was charged/convicted and minimum sentence,if any,as available in the Act as well as the period already undergone	Ratio of the decision
In the absence of such details,we are unable to rely on those orders	Ratio of the decision
From the analysis of the above decisions and the concerned provisions with which we are concerned,the following principles emerge: "a) When the Court issues notice confining to particular aspect/sentence,arguments will be heard only to that extent unless some extraordinary circumstance/material is shown to the Court for arguing the matter on all aspects	Ratio of the decision
Long delay in disposal of appeal or any other factor may not be a ground for reduction of sentence,particularly,when the statute prescribes minimum sentence	Ratio of the decision
In other cases where no such minimum sentence is prescribed,it is open to the Court to consider the delay and its effect and the ultimate decision	Ratio of the decision
In a case of corruption by public servant,quantum of amount is immaterial	Ratio of the decision
Ultimately it depends upon the conduct of the delinquent and the proof regarding demand and acceptance established by the prosecution	Ratio of the decision
Merely because the delinquent lost his job due to conviction under the Act may not be a mitigating circumstance for reduction of sentence,particularly,when the Statute prescribes minimum sentence	Ratio of the decision
Though Art.142 of the Constitution gives wider power to this Court,waiver of certain period as prescribed in the Statute imposing lesser sentence than the minimum prescribed is not permissible	Ratio of the decision
An order,which this Court can make in order to do complete justice between the parties,must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution,but also it cannot even be inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the relevant Statute	Ratio of the decision
In other words,this Court cannot altogether ignore the substantive provisions of a Statute	Ratio of the decision
g	Ratio of the decision
In exercise of the power u/art.142 of the Constitution,this Court generally does not pass an order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor is the power exercised merely on sympathy	Ratio of the decision
h	Ratio of the decision
The power u/art.142 of the Constitution is a constitutional power and not restricted by statutory enactments	Ratio of the decision
However,this Court would not pass any order u/art.142 which would amount to supplant the substantive law applicable or ignoring statutory provisions dealing with the subject	Ratio of the decision
In other words,acting under Article 142,this Court cannot pass an order or grant relief which is totally inconsistent or goes against the substantive or statutory enactments pertaining to the case	Ratio of the decision
i	Ratio of the decision
The powers u/art.142 are not meant to be exercised when their exercise may come directly in conflict with what has been expressly provided for in statute dealing expressly with the subject	Ratio of the decision
In the light of the above discussion,we are unable to accept any of the contentions raised by the learned senior counsel for the appellant,on the other hand,we are in entire agreement with the conclusion arrived at by the trial Judge as affirmed by the High Court	Ratio of the decision
Consequently,the appeal fails and the same is dismissed	Ratio of the decision
Since the appellant is on bail,the bail bonds executed by him stand cancelled	Ratio of the decision
The trial Judge is directed to secure his presence for serving the remaining period of sentence	Ruling by Present Court
Appeal dismissed	Ruling by Present Court
