Ms. Vibha Datta Makhija, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants contended that the evidence of the witnesses suffers from material discrepancy and is self- contradictory	Argument
It was submitted that injured witness Sukhbir was not examined in the court and neither CT Scan nor x-ray nor operational notes of Sukhbir were produced before the court and in the absence of such material evidence, courts below erred in convicting the second accused u/s	Argument
307 IPC	Ratio of the decision
Additionally, the learned counsel contended that the defence plea of private defence was not considered by the courts below in proper perspective	Argument
Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-State contended that the evidence of all the witnesses satisfactorily establishes the overt act of the accused persons and Jagdish (PW-5) and Mange Ram (PW-6) being the injured witnesses, the veracity of these witnesses cannot be doubted	Argument
It was submitted that the medical evidence sufficiently corroborated the oral evidence and the prosecution has established the intention of the 2nd accused in causing attempt to commit murder of Sukhbir and in appreciation of the evidence, courts below recorded concurrent findings convicting the second accused u/s	Argument
307 IPC and the same warrants no interference	Argument
We have carefully considered the rival contentions and gone through the impugned judgment and perused the materials on record	Ratio of the decision
As it emerges from the evidence, complainant Jagdish (PW-5) and his two sons Sukhbir and Mange Ram were cutting pullas	Ratio of the decision
The accused party went there and asked them not to cut the pullas	Ratio of the decision
In the wordy altercation, second accused Rajbir	Ratio of the decision
Raju gave pharsi blows on the head of Sukhbir	Ratio of the decision
PWs 5 & 6 have clearly spoken about the overt act of the accused that A-1 Jage Ram attacked and caused injury to PW-5 Jagdish with jaily blows and that second accused Rajbir	Ratio of the decision
Raju attacked on the head of Sukhbir with pharsi	Ratio of the decision
They have also stated that Madan and Rakesh caused injuries to PW5-Jagdish with lathi on shoulder and left elbow respectively	Ratio of the decision
PW	Ratio of the decision
2- Dr. Pardeep Kumar in his evidence stated that he has examined PWs 5 and 6 and noted the injuries on the body of PWs 5 and 6 and issued wound certificates	Ratio of the decision
Evidence of PWs 5 and 6 is amply corroborated by medical evidence	Ratio of the decision
PWs 5 and 6 being injured witnesses, their evidence is entitled to great weight	Ratio of the decision
Cogent and convincing grounds are required to discard the evidence of injured witnesses	Ratio of the decision
In the light of the fact that PWs 5 and 6 were injured witnesses, courts below tested their evidence for its credibility and recorded concurrent findings that PWs 5 and 6 are trustworthy witnesses	Ratio of the decision
We find no reason to take a different view	Ratio of the decision
Appellants have raised the contention that the prosecution failed to adduce evidence that A-2 Rajbir attempted to commit murder of Sukhbir	Argument
It was submitted that injured person Sukhbir was neither examined nor medical evidence like CT Scan, x-ray and operational notes and Sukhbir were produced to corroborate the oral evidence and while so courts below erred in convicting second accused Rajbir	Argument
Dr. Pardeep Kumar-PW-2, who examined Sukhbir found during his medico-legal examination a lacerated wound in the middle of the top of the skull	Facts
Injured-Sukhkbir was found vomiting in the hospital and he was examined by a Neuro Surgeon Dr. Hilol Kanti Pal (PW-9) of Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi on 19.11.1994, i.e. the day after the incident	Facts
PW-9 has stated that Sukhbir was unconscious since 2.00 P.M. on 18.11.1994 and was deeply comatose with irregularity of pupils and a laceration was diagnosed on the right front parietal region	Facts
Further, PW-9 has stated that during the CT scan, it was revealed that a large extra-dural haemotoma was present in the frontal region with mass effect and to avoid further deterioration of his condition, he was operated upon by frontal trephine craniopmy an haemotoma measuring about 125 ml was evacuated	Facts
PW-9	Facts
stated that had not the operation been conducted on Sukhbir and had not the extra-dural haemotoma removed by operation urgently, the head injury caused to Sukhbir would have caused his death	Facts
As noted by the High Court, it is thus brought on evidence that had not surgical assistance been given to Sukhbir, he would have definitely died	Facts
For the purpose of conviction u/s	Ratio of the decision
307 IPC, prosecution has to establish (i) the intention to commit murder and (ii) the act done by the accused	Ratio of the decision
The burden is on the prosecution that accused had attempted to commit the murder of the prosecution witness	Ratio of the decision
Whether the accused person intended to commit murder of another person would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case	Ratio of the decision
To justify a conviction u/s	Ratio of the decision
307 IPC, it is not essential that fatal injury capable of causing death should have been caused	Ratio of the decision
Although the nature of injury actually caused may be of assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of the accused, such intention may also be adduced from other circumstances	Ratio of the decision
The intention of the accused is to be gathered from the circumstances like the nature of the weapon used, words used by the accused at the time of the incident, motive of the accused, parts of the body where the injury was caused and the nature of injury and severity of the blows given etc	Ratio of the decision
In the case of State of M.P. vs. Kashiram & Ors	Precedent

SC 1642	Precedent
2009) 4 SCC 26 2009 Indlaw SC 92, the scope of intention for attracting conviction u/s	Precedent
307 IPC was elaborated and it was held as under	Precedent
It is sufficient to justify a conviction u/s	Precedent
307 if there is present an intent coupled with some overt act in execution thereof	Precedent
It is not essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted	Precedent
The section makes a distinction between the act of the accused and its result, if any	Precedent
The court has to see whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the section	Precedent
Therefore, an accused charged u/s	Precedent
307 IPC cannot be acquitted merely because the injuries inflicted on the victim were in the nature of a simple hurt	Precedent
This position was highlighted in State of Maharashtra v. Balram Bama Patil, (1983) 2 SCC 28 1983 Indlaw SC 414, Girija Shanker v. State of U.P.(2004) 3 SCC 793 2004 Indlaw SC 78 and R. Prakash v. State of Karnataka (2004) 9 SCC 27 2004 Indlaw SC 117	Precedent
Whether there was intention to kill or knowledge that death will be caused is a question of fact and would depend on the facts of a given case	Precedent
The circumstances that the injury inflicted by the accused was simple or minor will not by itself rule out application of S. 307 IPC	Precedent
The determinative question is the intention or knowledge, as the case may be, and not the nature of the injury	Precedent
State of M.P. v. Saleem (2005) 5 SCC 554 2005 Indlaw SC 413 Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious threats	Precedent
It is, therefore, the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed, etc	Precedent
This position was illuminatingly stated by this Court in Sevaka Perumal v. State of T.N.(1991) 3 SCC 471 1991 Indlaw SC 683	Precedent

Placing reliance upon the judgment of this Court in Hari Singh vs. Sukhbir Singh & Ors (1988) 4 SCC 551 1988 Indlaw SC 27., learned counsel for the appellants additionally submitted that in terms of S. 357 (3) Cr	Argument
P.C. that the compensation may be awarded to the victim and the sentence be modified to the period already undergone	Argument
For the conviction u/s	Ratio of the decision
307 IPC, courts below imposed upon the 2nd appellant rigorous imprisonment of five years, while imposing punishment, courts have an obligation to award appropriate punishment	Ratio of the decision
Question of awarding sentence is a matter of discretion and the same has to be exercised by the courts taking into consideration all the relevant circumstances	Ratio of the decision
What sentence would meet the ends of justice would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and the courts must keep in mind the gravity of the offence, motive for the crime, nature of the offence and all other attendant circumstances	Precedent

As noticed above, injured-Sukhbir sustained grievous head injuries and was deeply comatose and was in a state of shock and trauma	Ratio of the decision
Learned counsel for the injured-witness submitted that for quite some time injured-Sukhbir was unconscious and thereafter suffering from mental trauma	Argument
Having regard to the nature of injuries sustained by Sukhbir and the period of treatment and other circumstances, we are of the view that, it would be appropriate to direct second appellant- accused Rajbir	Ratio of the decision
Raju to pay Rs.7,50,000/- as compensation to the injured-Sukhbir	Ratio of the decision
