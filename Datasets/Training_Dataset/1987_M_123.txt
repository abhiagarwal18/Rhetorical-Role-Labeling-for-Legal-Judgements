Suspecting that the entry in the Protected Tenancy Register might not be genuine,on or about 24th of October,1970 the Tahsildar passed an order cancelling that entry	Facts
The main question centres around the right of Abdul Khader,respondent No.1 herein to the compensation awarded by the arbitrator,it is therefore,necessary to refer to the relevant portion of the said order which inter alia,stated as follows: "By perusal of the Tenancy Register of 1958 it is evident that Sri Mohd	Facts

This order of cancellation was challenged by Abdul Khadar by filing a writ petition in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh being W .P.No.1786 of 197 1 and by judgment and order passed on 27th August,197	Facts
1,the learned single Judge,Vaidya,J.held,inter alia,as follows: "Whether the petitioner (Abdul Khader) is a protected tenant or whether he has any prima facie interest in the suit property are matters entirely within the sole jurisdiction of the arbitrator who has to be appointed under S.8 of the 'Central Act	Facts
In the appeal of Abdul Khader the proceedings of Revenue Divisional Officer while questioning entry of the name of Abdul Khader in the Register is a genuine one or net and while it is stated that it was entered in the Register in such suspicious way by giving Serial No.1/A between Serial Nos.1 and 2 of Register being Exhibit A.106 and Exhibit A.107,it ultimately held that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant under section 37A of the Andhra Pradesh Act	Facts
On or about 19th of April,1972	Facts
the order was passed by the District Revenue Officer who held that Abdul Khader was not a protected tenant	Facts
He held further that Khasra Pahani which is the basic record of occupancy period after spot inspections does not find the name of Abdul Khader and further held that all entries except this entry in the Protected Tenancy Register prepared under section 37A of the Andhra Pradesh Act was supported by an enquiry	Facts
It was in those circumstances held by him that the entry was a spurious one	Facts
In Civil Revision Petition No.1006 of 1972 which was filed by Abdul Khader as against others,Justice R.Ramachandra Raju of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on or about 19th August,1974 held that Abdul Khader was not a protected tenant and directed deletion of entry made in the Final Record of tenancies as a spurious one	Facts
The learned Judge observed,inter alia,as follows: "I am told by the counsel for both the parties that the lands in question were already acquired for military purpose under the Requisition and Acquisition of Immovable property Act,1952 and that Sri M.S.Sharma,the Additional Chief Judge,City Civil Court,Hyderabad has already been appointed as Arbitrator under the Act for determining the compensation and the persons entitled to it	Ruling by Lower Court
Not only that,in the writ petition filed by the present petitioner in this Court,it was held that it is not necessary to go into the question whether the petitioner is a protected tenant or whether he has any prima facie interest in the property because they are the matters entirely within the sole jurisdiction of the arbitrator who has to be appointed under S.8 of the Act	Ruling by Lower Court
Now,as the arbitrator has already been appointed,he will go into the matter as to whether the petitioner was a protected tenant of the lands or not and if he was the protected tenant to what share in the compensation amount he would be entitled to	Ruling by Lower Court
Under these circumstances,the C.R.P.is dismissed with a direction that the entry made in the Final Record of Tenancies that the petitioner was the protected tenant,for the lands in question which is spurious as found by both the Revenue Divisional Officer and the District Revenue Officer should be deleted	Ruling by Lower Court
The matter was brought to this Court by a special leave application and this Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil	Ruling by Present Court
No.10 of 1975 on or about 30th January.1975 held that since the question whether the petitioner in that case namely,Abdul Khader was a protected tenant had been left open by the High Court to be decided by the Arbitrator u/s.8 of the Central Act,special leave petition was rejected with those observations	Ruling by Present Court
Thereafter there was an order appointing arbitrator on 29th of March,1975	Ruling by Present Court
u/s.8(1)(b) of the Central Act	Ruling by Present Court
Claim petition was filed by the appellant before the arbitrator' Claim petition was also filed by Abdul Khader claiming 60'% of compensation as a 'protected tenant	Ruling by Present Court
There was an award by the arbitrator holding that as this Court had left it open to decide whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant	Facts
Despite the objection exercising the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to go into the question of protected tenant,the arbitrator held that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant	Facts
Aggrieved by the aforesaid award,the appellant claiming as one of the owners of the property filed a statutory appeal to the High Court	Facts
In the meantime Abdul Khader filed an application on or about 21st of October,1984 for adducing additional evidence to mark Kaulnama dated 2nd of December,1950 for the first time and Oubuliatnama dated 2nd December,1950 as exhibits in deciding the protected tenancy rights	Facts
The appellant objected to that application but the High Court on 1st April,1985	Facts
appointed Advocate Commissioner to record additional evidence	Facts
On or about 22nd of April,1985	Facts
the appellant filed the objection reserving the right of raising the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to go into the question whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant in the light of the Act 21 of 1950.Three civil appeals were filed before this Court against the order of the High Court on 15th May,1985.This Court passed the order,on 19th August,1985.The said order is important and reads as follows:- "Special leave are granted	Facts

We agree with his submission	Facts
We direct that the appellants shall withdraw not more than 40 per cent of the compensation pending disposal of the appeal before the High Court	Facts

The judgment under appeal was passed on 15th of April,1986.This appeal arises out of the said judgment	Facts
In the judgment under appeal which is directed against the award made by the arbitrator formulated the following four issues--(1) what is the value of the land; (2) who are entitled to the compensation amount; (3) whether Abdul Khader is a protected tenant of Sail Gulshan of the area 19-02 guntas excluding the land of buildings,wells,etc.and (4) what share is to be apportioned to successors of Sail Nawaz Jung	Facts
It has to be borne in mind that in the award,the arbitrator after exhaustively discussing the evidence on record held that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant and as such further held that he was entitled to 60% of the compensation money payable for the acquisition of the land excluding the land of buildings,wells etc	Facts
In this appeal we are concerned with the question whether the High Court was right in upholding the award of the arbitrator so far as it has held in favour of Abdul Khader and his rights to get 60% of the compensation	Ratio of the decision
The High Court dealt with the value of the land	Ratio of the decision
We are not concerned with the challenge to this aspect in this appeal	Ratio of the decision

The judgment also dealt with the question as to who were the successors of Nawaz Jung	Facts
We are also not concerned with this aspect of the matter inasmuch as the same is the subject matter of another appeal being Civil Appeal No.4406 of 1986	Ratio of the decision
We are concerned in this appeal with the right of Abdul Khader	Ratio of the decision
The High Court discussed 18 documents out of which two are challans and other depositions	Facts
Kowlnama executed in favour of Shaik Hussain was not filed	Facts
The Kowlnama executed in favour of the son,Mohd	Facts

The High Court took into consideration the judgment in Suit No.13(1) of 195 1-52 by the tenant	Facts
The High Court on consideration of these documents was of the view that these documents showed unequivocally that the tenancy was in favour of Shaik Hussain from 1935.After his death Mohd	Facts

The land was taken possession of under a panchanama dated 12th of September,1963.According to the High Court the documents discussed in the judgment indicated that Shaik Hussain was a tenant from 1935.After his death on July 18,1949,his son Mohd	Facts
Abdul Khader became a tenant	Facts
In this background the Court addressed itself to the question whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant or not entitled to 60% of the compensation	Facts
No document was filed to show that Abdul Khader was declared by the revenue courts as a protected tenant	Ratio of the decision
The High Court was of the view that there was surfeit of evidence prior to the commencement of the Andhra Pradesh Act that Shaik Hussain was a tenant of the land	Facts
The question was whether on enforcement of the said Act Abdul Khader,respondent herein,was a protected tenant	Facts
The High Court thereafter discussed the facts mentioned hereinbefore about the order of the District Revenue Officer and the orders of this Court referred to hereinbefore	Facts
The High Court noticed the position that under the said Andhra Pradesh Act it was for the revenue authorities to order whether a tenant is a protected tenant under section 34,s.37 'and section 37A of the said Act	Facts
Section 37A was enacted on 12th of March,1956.The High Court was,however,of the view that it cannot be said that it was for the revenue authorities alone to decide the issue because the arbitrator was ordered to decide the issue by the High Court on 19th August,1974 and by this Court on 30th of January,1975.The High Court also referred to the directions of this Court dated 19th August,1985 mentioned hereinbefore	Facts
The High Court was of the view that the arbitrator was to decide that question and the arbitrator was not in error in deciding the issue in the manner it did	Facts
The Court reiterated that there was surfeit of evidence to declare that Abdul Khader was a tenant	Facts
If he was a tenant,the High Court observed.he was a protected tenant under s.34 read with s.37 or under section 37-A of the Andhra Pradesh Act	Facts
The High Court on reciting the facts came to the conclusions,inter alia	Ruling by Lower Court
a) that Abdul Khader because he was a tenant between January,1942 to January,1948 for six years,therefore,was a protected tenant under sub-cl.(ii) of cl.(1) of s.34 of the Andhra Pradesh Act; (b) that Abdul Khader held the land from October,1943 to October,1949,therefore,was a protected tenant of Sail Gulshan under sub-cl.(iii) of cl.(1) of s.34 of Act 21 of 1950.In these circumstances,the High Court held that Adbul Khader was entitled to 60% of the compensation paid	Ruling by Lower Court
Aggrieved by the aforesaid decision,the appellants being the successor of the owner of the land in question is in appeal before us	Ratio of the decision
Shri Shanker Ghosh,learned counsel for the appellant,urged that under the said Andhra Pradesh Act it was mandatory under s.99 read with s.102 of the said Act in conjunction with the definition of s.2(r) of the Act for the revenue authorities to decide whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant or not	Argument
There being no such finding by the revenue officer,on the other hand there being a finding mat Abdul Khader was not a protected tenant by the revenue authorities it was not open to the arbitrator to decide the question of protected tenancy	Ratio of the decision
The arbitrator therefore,exceeded his jurisdiction and the High Court was in error	Ratio of the decision
Shri A.K.Sen,on behalf of the respondents on the other hand contended that the compensation payable in respect of the requisitioning and acquisition must be determined under the Central Act and the arbitrator was the authority to decide that question	Argument
The question of Abdul Khader's right to compensation had to be decided in accordance with law	Argument
He had claimed rights of a protected tenant	Argument
He had sought to establish his rights which must be found within the four corners of the Andhra Pradesh Act along with other documents because u/s.40(4) of the Andhra Pradesh Act the interest of a protected tenant in the land held by him as a protected tenant formed 60%.The rights of the protected tenants have been defined in the Andhra Pradesh Act and relevant provisions of that Act namely,sections 34,37,37A and 40 in conjunction with the definition under s.2(r) have to be taken into consideration in the background of the facts and circumstances of the case	Argument
The two orders of this Court as we have mentioned hereinbefore dated 30th of January,1975 and 19th of August.1985 reiterated the position that it was for the arbitrator to decide the question and he should decide the question in the light of ss.99 and 102 of the Andhra Pradesh Act as set out hereinbefore	Argument
On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that there was a complete bar for any civil court to go into the question whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant and as such the arbitrator and the High Court had no jurisdiction to decide this question	Argument
For this reliance was placed on S.102 of the Andhra Pradesh Act which lays down that the Act will not apply to lands leased,granted,alienated or acquired in favour of or by the Central Government or the State Government etc.and on -S.99 of the Act which bars the jurisdiction of civil courts to deal with any question which is under the Andhra Pradesh Act required to be settled,to be decided or dealt with by the Tahsildar,Tribunal or Collector	Argument
According to the appellant inasmuch as whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant had not to be settled by the Collector or the Tribunal,the arbitrator and the High Court were in error in going to that question	Argument
We are unable to accept this submission	Ratio of the decision
By the scheme of the Central Act compensation was payable to persons who had interest in the land acquired	Ratio of the decision
Who are the persons who have interest in the land had to be decided in accordance with the law and the evidence	Ratio of the decision
Determination by the revenue authorities and non-determination is not conclusive or decisive	Ratio of the decision
It is clear that s.102 of the Andhra Pradesh Act mentions that after acquisition the Act was not to apply in respect of certain land	Ratio of the decision
Therefore,it was submitted by the respondents that s.99 of the Andhra Pradesh Act.which made the determination by the Tahsildar to be final and debarred other courts from going into the question did not apply in case of compensation payable	Ratio of the decision
In the background of the totality of circumstances as manifest in the different orders it appeared to the arbitrator and the Court that the entry which was made in favour of Abdul Khader as the protected tenant was of doubtful validity	Ratio of the decision
We are of the opinion that the High Court was not in error in so holding	Ratio of the decision
It was the observation of the revenue authorities that it was spurious	Ratio of the decision
That in any event what was the interest of Abdul Khader had to be determined in determining the question of payment of compensation to him and in so determining the facts and circumstances and the proceedings before the revenue authorities and entries and subsequent deletions had to be taken into consideration by the arbitrator	Ratio of the decision
The arbitrator has done so	Ratio of the decision
He had jurisdiction to do so	Ratio of the decision
The High Court has so held	Ratio of the decision
This Court by the two orders referred to hereinbefore had also affirmed this position	Ratio of the decision
In that view of the matter we are unable to accept the challenge to the award	Ratio of the decision
Furthermore,under s.99 of the Andhra Pradesh Act the bar was not against the arbitrator but against a civil court	Ratio of the decision
In determining the amount of compensation payable to Abdul Khader under the Central Act,his interests in the property had to be determined	Ratio of the decision
In another context,the High Court of Andhra Pradesh enunciated the position that it was necessary to determine the interest of the persons claiming compensation	Ratio of the decision
Reference may be made to the decision in the case of Archi Appalareddi and another v	Precedent
Special Tahsildar,land Acquisition,Visakhapatnam Municipality and mother,[1979] Andhra Weekly Reporter,Vol.1 p.101,where the Court observed in the context of the Land Acquisition Act that a tenant was a 'person interested' as defined in clause (b) of s.3 of the Land Acquisition Act	Precedent
He has a right to object to the acquisition and/or the quantum of compensation	Precedent
The Land Acquisition Officer or the Court,as the case may be,had to ascertain the value of a claimant's right in the property acquired and compensate him in that behalf	Ratio of the decision
We may mention that in the two orders of this Court dated 30th of January,1975 and 19th of August,1985 referred to herein before,this Court had left it open to the High Court and to the arbitrator to decide whether he is a protected tenant or not.the arbitrator has decided that question and the High Court found over whelming evidence in support of it	Ratio of the decision
In that view of the matter we must uphold that decision however unsatisfactory	Ratio of the decision
it might appear that a fruit pucker gets 60% of the compensation while the owners get only If that is the law	Ratio of the decision
let it be	Ratio of the decision
In the aforesaid view of the matter this appeal must fail and is accordingly dismissed with costs	Ruling by Present Court
Appeal dismissed	Ruling by Present Court
