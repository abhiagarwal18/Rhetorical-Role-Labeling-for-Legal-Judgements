The main witnesses regarding the alleged demand of money and also harassment and beating to Bhimabai are her father and mother, viz	Ratio of the decision
PW.1 Tukaram and PW.5 Sumanbai	Ratio of the decision
In his examination-in-chief PW.1 has said that whenever his daughter came to her parental home, she used to complain that she was being subjected to harassment by the appellants on account of some "domestic reasons" and further that her husband (appellant no.1) had told her that while coming back from her parental home she should bring Rs	Ratio of the decision
1,000-1,200 for expenses and for manure as he had no sufficient money	Ratio of the decision
PW.5 Sumanbai has deposed that Bhimabai was receiving ill-treatment as a result of "domestic cause" and to a specific question put by the Court as to what she meant by "domestic cause" she gave a reply that there was a demand for money for defraying expenses of manure etc	Ratio of the decision
It is important to note that in her statement under Section 161 Cr	Ratio of the decision
P.C. which was recorded on the very next day of the death of Bhimabai, this witness did not state that the cause for ill-treatment was "a demand for money and a consequent beating	Ratio of the decision
The evidence on record does not indicate that the police had any reason to favour the accused and deliberately omitted to mention about the alleged demand of money while recording the statement of PW.5 Sumanbai under Section 161 Cr	Ratio of the decision
The evidence shows that the accused come from very humble background and they could not have exerted any kind of influence, financial or otherwise, upon the police so as to manage a statement favourable to them when in the course of investigation the statements of witnesses were being recorded under Section 161 Cr	Ratio of the decision
Accepting the statements of father and mother on their face value that utmost which can be held is that the appellant no.1 had asked his wife Bhimabai to bring money for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure	Ratio of the decision
Two essential ingredient of Section 304-B IPC, apart from others, are (i) death of women is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances, and (ii) women is subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for "dowry	Statute
The explanation appended to sub-section (1) of Section 304-B IPC says that "dowry" shall have the same meaning as in Section 2 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961	Statute
Section 2 of Dowry Prohibition Act reads as under :- "2. Definition of "dowry" - In this Act "dowry" means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly- (a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage; or (b) by the parent of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person, at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of the said parties, but does not include dowry or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law (shariat) applies	Statute
In view of the aforesaid definition of the word "dowry" any property or valuable security should be given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly at or before or any time after the marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties	Ratio of the decision
Therefore, the giving or taking of property or valuable security must have some connection with the marriage of the parties and a correlation between the giving or taking of property or valuable security with the marriage of the parties is essential	Ratio of the decision
Being a penal provision it has to be strictly construed	Ratio of the decision
Dowry is a fairly well known social custom or practice in India	Ratio of the decision
It is well settled principle of interpretation of Statute that if the Act is passed with reference to a particular trade, business or transaction and words are used which everybody conversant with that trade, business or transaction knows or understands to have a particular meaning in it, then the words are to be construed as having that particular meaning	Ratio of the decision
See Union of India v. Garware Nylons Ltd., AIR (1996	Ratio of the decision
SC 3509 1996 Indlaw SC 2404 and Chemicals and Fibres of India v. Union of India, AIR (1997	Ratio of the decision
SC 558 1991 Indlaw SC 861	Ratio of the decision
A demand for money on account of some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses of for purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry as the said word is normally understood	Ratio of the decision
The evidence adduced by the prosecution does not, therefore, show that any demand for "dowry" as defined in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act was made by the appellants as what was allegedly asked for was some money for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure	Ratio of the decision
Since an essential ingredient of Section 304-B IPC viz	Ratio of the decision
demand for dowry is not established, the conviction of the appellants cannot be sustained	Ratio of the decision
Learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that there is absolutely no evidence either direct or circumstantial to show that Bhimabai committed suicide	Argument
He has submitted that the insecticide Thimet is extensively used by the farmers for preservation of crop and is kept stored in their houses and it could be a case where Thimet accidentally got mixed with some food item and was consumed by Bhaimabai	Argument
It has thus been submitted that no offence under Section 306 IPC is made out against the appellants	Argument
We do not consider it necessary to examine this question	Ratio of the decision
As already stated, the appellants were also charged under Sections 498-A and 306 read with Section 34 IPC but were acquitted of the said charges by the learned Sessions Judge, which order has attained finality for the reason that the State did not prefer appeal against the same	Ratio of the decision
The appeal before the High Court and also in this Court has been preferred by the appellants challenging their conviction under section 304-B read with section 34 IPC	Ratio of the decision
It has been held in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Thadi Narayan, AIR (1962	Precedent
SC 240 1961 Indlaw SC 171 that Section 423(1)(b)(i) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (which corresponds to Section 386(b)(i) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973) is clearly confined to cases of appeals preferred against orders of conviction and sentence, the powers conferred by this clause cannot be exercised for the purpose of reversing an order of acquittal passed in favour of a party in respect of an offence charged, in dealing with an appeal preferred by him against the order of conviction in respect of another offence charged and found proved	Precedent
Therefore, we have refrained from expressing any opinion as to whether the appellants could be held guilty of having committed the offence under Section 498-A or 306 IPC on the basis of evidence available on record as their acquittal under the aforesaid charges has attained finality and cannot be reversed in the appeal filed by the appellants challenging their conviction under Section 304-B IPC	Ratio of the decision
In view of the discussion made above, the appeal is allowed	Ruling by Present Court
The judgment and order dated 23 February 2005 of the High Court and the judgment and order dated 04 January 1993 of the learned Sessions Judge convicting the appellants under Section 304-B IPC are set aside and the appellants are acquitted of the said charge	Ruling by Present Court
The appellant no.1 is in custody	Ruling by Present Court
He shall be released forthwith unless wanted in some other case	Ruling by Present Court
The appellant no. 2 is on bail	Ruling by Present Court
The sureties and bail bonds furnished by her are discharged	Ruling by Present Court
Appeal allowed	Ruling by Present Court
