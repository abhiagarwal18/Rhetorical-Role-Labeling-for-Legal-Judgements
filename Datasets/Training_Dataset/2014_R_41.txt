He participated in the identification parade,which was held in Sub Jail,Bemetara,and identified the accused persons in the court by touching them	Facts
We have carefully examined the manner in which the identification parade was conducted and the manner in which the boy -Anil Kumar (PW-21) identified the accused in Court and we have no reason to doubt the identification of the accused,which assumes importance in this case since the boy did not know the accused before the incident	Ratio of the decision
It is Anil Kumar (PW -21),who first informed the head of the family Dr	Facts
Sharda Prasad Tripathi (PW-1),the complainant,about the incident,when he came home after closing his clinic	Facts
He deposed before the Court that Shashi Didi (accused) brought him to village -Jevra from Bilaspur	Facts
He lived in the house of Shashi Didi	Facts

The incident occurred in the courtyard and Shashi Didi was present in the passage	Facts
Mahesh,the fourth accused,was standing outside the house	Facts
After the assault,Chandra Prakash went to the TV room where Shashi Didi had kept some money in a rubber band on the table	Facts
The accused -Chandra Prakash had threatened him not to disclose anything about the incident to anyone	Facts
Thereafter all the three accused fled from there	Facts
He further deposed that Shashi Didi took him upstairs to the terrace and asked him not to disclose the truth to anyone but to say that thieves came into the house and committed the crime	Facts
Shashi Didi thereafter started shouting	Facts
Then she lay down on the courtyard near Bhavna Bhabhi	Facts
This deposition clearly implicates accused Nos.1,2 and 4.The picture that emerges is that Shashi Tripathi caused Bhavna to be killed and for this purpose engaged Chandra Prakash (accused No.2) and Raju	Ratio of the decision
Devendra Choubey (accused No.4) by paying them money	Ratio of the decision
She also seems to have had a scuffle with Bhavna,which is apparent from the fact that her hair was found in the grip of the deceased during investigation	Ratio of the decision
It is obvious that accused nos.2 and 4 did not enter the house to commit a robbery and had a single mission,namely,to kill Bhavana	Ratio of the decision
There is no evidence that they had any previous animosity with the deceased and appeared to have acted as contract killers	Ratio of the decision
The prosecution has found it difficult to pinpoint the motive but Shashi Tripathi's husband Dr	Ratio of the decision
Sharda Prasad Tripathi (PW-1) deposed before the Court that she tried to create a hindrance in the marriage of his son Jitendra since she wanted her daughter Abhilasha to marry him; however,he went ahead with the marriage of Jitendra to Bhavna,whereupon Shashi Tripathi remained silent	Ratio of the decision
The credibility of the evidence of Anil Kumar (PW-21) was attacked by the learned counsel for the appellants,who submitted that the boy is a tutored witness,who has been influenced by the police with whom he spent a lot of time	Argument
In fact,he even came to the Court in the company of a police constable after being served summons at Allahabad	Argument
The learned counsel submitted that the evidence of a child witness must be carefully scrutinized before acceptance since a child can be easy prey for tutoring and the court must insist on corroboration from other evidence	Argument
On a careful perusal of the deposition of this child witness,we have not found any reason why he would have lied	Ratio of the decision
He was brought to the house by Shashi Tripathi (accused),who apparently took care of him and sent to school and gave him food and residence	Ratio of the decision
He had no grouse against her neither any ulterior motive in identifying the accused,who were not acquainted to him	Ratio of the decision
There was no reason for the sole eye witness -Anil (PW-21) to implicate anybody falsely	Ratio of the decision
Merely because he has been some time in the company of the police at the police station his testimony cannot be discarded as untrue	Ratio of the decision
The incident occurred within the four walls of the house of the accused -Shashi Tripathi and the only witness was the boy -Anil	Ratio of the decision
PW-21).His statement that the accused Chandra Prakash attacked the deceased is corroborated by the recovery of knife from Chandra Prakash	Ratio of the decision
It must be remembered that the boy comes from a rural back ground and was 13 years of age when the incident occurred	Ratio of the decision
His presence in the house is entirely natural and we have no reason to discard his testimony	Ratio of the decision
The learned counsel for the appellants forcefully attacked the conviction of the other accused viz	Argument
Mahesh,Chandra Prakash and Devendra Kumar,who admittedly were not known to the child witness Anil Kumar	Argument
It was submitted that the test identification parade were delayed and the identification of these accused by the witness in Court was not reliable	Argument
It is not possible for us to accept this contention	Ratio of the decision
Mahesh and Chandra Prakash were arrested on 29.11.2003,their identification parade was conducted on 13.12.2003 -(within a fortnight or so	Ratio of the decision
The accused Devendra Kumar was arrested on 22.12.2003 and his identification parade was conducted on 26.12.2003-(within four days).There is no evidence on record to show that the child witness had an opportunity to see and study the features of the accused between their arrest and test identification parade to enable a tutored identification	Ratio of the decision
In any case,the period between the arrest and the identification parade was not large enough to constitute inordinate delay	Ratio of the decision
The learned counsel for the appellants relied upon the Judgment of this Court in Budhsen and Anr	Precedent
Vs	Precedent
State of U.P.(1970) 2 SCC 128 1970 Indlaw SC 136 where this Court made the following observations:- "7.Now,facts which establish the identity of an accused person are relevant u/s.9 of the Indian Evidence Act	Precedent
As a general rule,the substantive evidence of a witness is a statement made in court	Precedent
The evidence of mere identification of the accused person at the trial for the first time is from its very nature inherently of a weak character	Precedent
The evidence in order to carry conviction should ordinarily clarify as to how and under what circumstances he came to pick out the particular accused person and the details of the part which the accused played in the crime in question with reasonable particularity	Precedent
The purpose of a prior test identification,therefore,seems to be to test and strengthen the trustworthiness of that evidence	Precedent
It is accordingly considered a safe rule of prudence to generally look for corroboration of the sworn testimony of witnesses in court as to the identity of the accused who are strangers to them,in the form of earlier identification proceeding	Precedent
There may,however,be exceptions to this general rule,when for example,the court is impressed by a particular witness,on whose testimony it can safely rely,without such or other corroboration	Precedent
The identification parades belong to the investigation stage	Precedent
They are generally held during the course of investigation with the primary object of enabling the witnesses to identify persons concerned in the offence,who were not previously known to them	Precedent
This serves to satisfy the investigating officers of the bona fides of the prosecution witnesses and also to furnish evidence to corroborate their testimony in court	Precedent
Identification proceedings in their legal effect amount simply to this: that certain persons are brought to jail or some other place and make statements either express or implied that certain individuals whom they point out are persons whom they recognise as having been concerned in the crime	Precedent
They do not constitute substantive evidence	Precedent
These parades are of the essentially governed by Section 162,Criminal Procedure Code	Precedent
It is for this reason that the identification parades in this case seem to have been held under the supervision of a Magistrate	Precedent
Keeping in view the purpose of identification parades the Magistrates holding them are expected to take all possible precautions to eliminate any suspicion of unfairness and to reduce the chance of testimonial error	Precedent
They must,therefore,take intelligent interest in the proceedings,bearing in mind two considerations: (i) that the life and liberty of an accused may depend on their vigilance and caution and (ii) that justice should be done in the identification	Precedent
Those proceeding should not make it impossible for the identifiers who,after all,have,as a rule,only fleeting glimpses of the person they are supposed to identify	Precedent
Generally speaking,the Magistrate must make a note of every objection raised by an accused at the time of identification and the steps taken by them to ensure fairness to the accused,so that the court which is to judge the value of the identification evidence may take them into consideration in the appreciation of that evidence	Precedent
The power to identify,it may be kept in view,varies according to the power of observation and memory of the person identifying and each case depends on its own facts,but there are two factors which seem to be of basic importance in the evaluation of identification	Precedent
The persons required to identify an accused should have had no opportunity of seeing him after the commission of the crime and before identification and secondly that no mistakes are made by them or the mistakes made are negligible	Precedent
The identification to be of value should also be held without much delay	Precedent
The number of persons mixed up with the accused should be reasonably large and their bearing and general appearance not glaringly dissimilar	Precedent
The evidence as to identification deserves,therefore,to be subjected to a close and careful scrutiny by the Court	Precedent
The observations of this Court undoubtedly lay down the correct law and we have no reason to doubt them	Ratio of the decision
We,however,do not see how the observations help the appellants	Ratio of the decision
In the present case,the child witness has been found to be reliable	Ratio of the decision
His presence is not doubted,since he resided with the family for whom he worked	Ratio of the decision
He had no axe to grind against any of the accused	Ratio of the decision
He became the unfortunate witness of a gruesome murder and fearlessly identified the accused in Court	Ratio of the decision
In his deposition he specified the details of the part which the accused played with reasonable particularity	Ratio of the decision
In such a situation,it is considered a safe rule of prudence to generally look for corroboration of the sworn testimony of witness in Court as to the identity of the accused who are strangers to them,in the form of earlier identification proceeding,as observed by this Court in Budhsen's case 1970 Indlaw SC 136 (supra	Ratio of the decision
This Court has not laid down the requirement in general that all identification parades must be under the supervision of a Magistrate as in Budhsen's case 1970 Indlaw SC 136 (supra).The learned counsel for the appellants also relied upon the Judgments of this Court in Subash and Shiv Kumar Vs	Ratio of the decision
State of U.P.(1987) 3 SCC 331 1987 Indlaw SC 28887,and Mohd	Ratio of the decision
Abdul Hafeez Vs	Ratio of the decision
State of Andhra Pradesh AIR 1983	Ratio of the decision
SC 367 1982 Indlaw SC 63.The facts and circumstances of the cases are however different and it is not necessary to consider those cases in detail while dealing with the present case	Ratio of the decision
Suffice it to say that those cases do not create any doubt as regards the conviction in this case	Ratio of the decision
Mr	Argument
P.C.Agrawala,learned senior counsel for the appellant Mahesh (accused no.3),vehemently submitted that this accused ought not to have been convicted u/s.302 with the aid of Ss.34 and 120 (B) of IPC.In particular it was submitted that the role attributed to the accused was that he merely stood outside the house	Argument
He did not even act as a guard because when the witness Anil Kumar (PW-21) came to the house,he was not even stopped by the accused from entering the house	Argument
The learned counsel for Mahesh (accused no.3) relied on several decisions of this Court in Suresh Sakharam Nangare Vs	Argument
State of Maharashtra (2012) 9 SCC 249 2012 Indlaw SC 304,Jai Bhagwan Vs	Argument
State of Haryana AIR 1999 SC 1083 1999 Indlaw SC 391 and Ramashish Yadav Vs	Argument
State of Bihar (1999) 8 SCC 555 1999 Indlaw SC 693	Argument
It is settled law that common intention and conspiracy are matters of inference and if while drawing an inference any benefit of doubt creeps in,it must go to the accused vide Baliya Vs	Ratio of the decision
State of M.P.(2012	Ratio of the decision
9 SCC 696 2012 Indlaw SC 343	Ratio of the decision
On a careful conspectus of the facts and the law,we are of the view that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of Mahesh beyond reasonable doubt	Ratio of the decision
There is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime	Ratio of the decision
He was merely seen by the witness as standing outside the house when the witness came home	Ratio of the decision
Mahesh did not even act as a guard; he did not prevent Anil Kumar (PW-21) from entering the house	Ratio of the decision
There is no evidence of the formation or sharing of any common intention with the other accused	Ratio of the decision
There is no reference to a third person in the FIR; no evidence that he came with the other accused or left with them	Ratio of the decision
No weapon was seized from him,nor was any property connected with the crime,seized	Ratio of the decision
Having regard to the role attributed to him and the absence of incriminating factors we find that it is not safe to convict Mahesh of the offence of murder with the aid of Ss.34 and 120(B	Ratio of the decision
We therefore,hold that the accused Mahesh (accused no.3) in Criminal Appeal No.867 of 2013 is innocent and the conviction against him is set aside	Ruling by Present Court
His bail bonds stand cancelled and sureties are discharged	Ruling by Present Court
In view of the above,Criminal Appeal No.867 of 2013 is allowed and Criminal Appeal Nos.822 of 2012,589 of 2014 and Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Criminal) No.3737 of 2014 are dismissed	Ruling by Present Court
Appeals disposed of	Ruling by Present Court
