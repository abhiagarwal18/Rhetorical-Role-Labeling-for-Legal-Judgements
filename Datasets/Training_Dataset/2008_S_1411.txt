Interpretation and/ or application of the provisions of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act,1976 (for short "the Act") and the Rules framed thereunder known as the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Rules,1979	Ratio of the decision
for short "the Rules") is in question in this appeal which arises out of a judgment and order dated 27.12.2006 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in Letters Patent Appeal No.1611 of 2006 arising out of a judgment and order dated 23.11.2006 passed by a learned Single Judge of the said Court in SCA No.7092 of 2001	Ratio of the decision
Before embarking upon the issue involved in this appeal,we may notice the admitted fact of the matter	Ratio of the decision
The Government of Gujarat in exercise of its power conferred upon it u/s.65 of the Act made a scheme in respect of the town of Umra,Surat on 1.06.1999	Ratio of the decision
Plot Nos.17/7 and 17/8 were owned by Respondent No.4 herein	Facts
Appellant was a tenant under the said respondent in respect of Plot No.17/8 admeasuring 1067 sq.m	Facts
He used to run a business of marble and stone therein	Facts
A road widening project was proposed in terms of the said scheme	Facts
Notices therefor were issued both to the appellant as also the respondent no	Facts
Appellant objected thereto	Facts
He,however,did not pursue his case in regard to the proposal for widening of the road	Facts
For the said public purpose,viz.,widening of the road,867 sq.m.of land was taken over leaving only 200 sq.m.of land	Facts
With a view to give effect to the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder,proceedings were initiated for allotment of the said land in terms of the Act.20% of the land was taken over without payment of any compensation	Facts
In respect of the proceedings initiated for the purpose of re-allotment of the land,despite a public notice,the appellant did not file any objection	Facts
He did not take any part in the proceedings therefor	Facts
Respondent No.4 was allotted a final plot bearing No.157 and the said 200 sq.m.of land of plot No.17/8 has merged in final plot No.165 owned by the respondent No.3	Facts
The Scheme was notified in the year 1999.Respondent No.1 herein which is the statutory agency in terms of the Act for the purpose of implementation of the Scheme issued a notice u/s.67 of the Act upon the respondent no.4 on or about 15.01.2000.As he did not respond thereto,a notice u/s.68 of the Act was served on him on 31.03.2000 stating: "As per the said approved preliminary scheme the plot No.157 is allotted to you	Facts
And,its pole demarcations were done by the town planning officer at site	Facts
The said Final Plot/ Original Plot is allotted in lieu of your No.17/7,17/8 paiki land	Facts
And,the said land is now vested in the Municipal Corporation from 1.7.1999,and is of the ownership of the Municipal Corporation	Facts
Thereafter the notice below s.67 for the change in occupation was issued on 15.1.2000 to you	Facts
In spite of this you have not handed over the possession	Facts
Therefore,as per the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Rules,1979 rule 33 the undersigned in exercise of powers conferred below s.68(1) and 8(2) of the Bombay Provincial Municipalities Act and below the s.68 notice under the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act this is to inform you that as shown in the sketch on the reverse the premises marked should be vacated within 7 days from receipt of the notice and had over the possession to the Surat Municipal Corporation	Facts
If you fail to do so then on completion of the stipulated time limit as per the Rule 33 of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Rules,1979 the said land and the occupation on the same will be summarily evicted and your occupation will be removed and if you obstruct/ interfere on it after taking away the possession you trespass then as provided under Rule 33 of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Rules,1979	Facts
the Action as per the s.188 of the Indian Penal Code will be initiated against you before the Criminal Court,pleased take note of the same	Facts
The validity and/ or legality of the said notice was questioned by the appellant by filing a writ petition in the High Court of Gujarat inter alia contending that the purported final allotment of plot No.165 in favour of the respondent no.3 and allotment of final plot No.157 in favour of the respondent no.4 were made without issuing any notice as envisaged u/ss.52 and 53 of the Act	Facts
In the said writ petition,it was prayed: " On the facts and circumstances mentioned herein above,the Petitioner prays to your Lordships that: (A) Be pleased to issue writ of Mandamus or writ in the nature of Mandamus or appropriate writ,order or direction,quashing and setting aside the impugned action of acquiring and demolishing the structures available on the land in question,i.e.,Original Plot No.17/A -R.S.No.17/P,situated at Umra,Surat	Facts
A learned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the said writ petition inter alia opining that the interest of landlord and tenant being common and in absence of any inter se dispute between them even if any portion of the land which remained in possession of the tenant was included in the Scheme,the proper remedy would be to claim compensation to that extent,holding: " It appears that in the said decision,the Apex Court while considering the scheme on the touch-stone of the mandatory procedure to be followed by the authority under the Bombay Town Planning Rules,has given directions to provide alternative accommodation based on the earlier decision in case of Jaswantsingh Mathurasingh and upheld the scheme	Ruling by Lower Court
Such is not the issue in the present case nor there is any complaint by the tenant that any special notice was not served or that the mandatory procedure for finalization of the scheme is not followed	Ruling by Lower Court
Further,it appears that if the interest of the landlord and of the tenant is common and in absence of any inter se dispute between the landlord and tenant,even if any portion of the land which is in possession of the tenant is included in the scheme,the proper remedy for the tenant would be to claim for compensation to that extent and if such compensation is not received by him,he may resort to proper remedy available for recovery of the compensation to the extent of the area in his occupation	Ruling by Lower Court
At least on ground that the tenant is in occupation,it would not be a case for interference with the scheme which is sanctioned and made a part of the statute	Ruling by Lower Court
Suffice it to say that the tenant will be at liberty to resort to appropriate proceedings against the landlord for the inter se rights and also for entitlement of the compensation	Ruling by Lower Court
But if the area of original plot no.17/8 is included in the final scheme and in exchange of the original plot held by Keshav Gramini of 17/8 and 17/7,the final plot is already allotted and as observed earlier it was even otherwise in the ownership of the original holder and it is only on account of inter se dispute the other persons are lawfully occupying the land,the tenant cannot insist that his landlord must be allotted the land of final plot no.157 simultaneously,when he is to be evicted or deprived of the portion of the land of original plot no.17/8.Therefore,in my view considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case,the decision of the Apex Court in case of Mansukhlal1991 Indlaw SC 975 (supra) cannot be made applicable to the present case	Ruling by Lower Court
A Division Bench of the High Court dismissed an intra-court appeal preferred thereagainst	Facts
Mr.U.U.Lalit,learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant,in support of this appeal,inter alia would submit: "(i	Argument
The provisions of Ss.52 and 81 being imperative in character,no acquisition of land is permissible without service of any notice upon the persons interested which would include a tenant in occupation and carrying on business thereon	Argument
ii	Argument
A tenant having regard to the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act or otherwise having an interest in the property cannot be deprived therefrom without following the procedure established by law and without initiation of any proceedings for acquisition of land	Argument
iii	Argument
The tenant's interest being distinct and separate could not have been held to be merged with the interest of the landlord,either for the purpose of allotment of a final plot or otherwise in favour of the landlord	Argument
iv	Argument
Appellant having a right over the remaining 200 sq.m.of the land of original plot No.17/8 should be allowed to continue thereupon and final allotment made in favour of the respondent no.3 to that extent should be cancelled	Argument
Mr	Ratio of the decision
Lalit in support of his contention strongly relied upon a decision of this Court in Mansukhlal Jadavji Darji and Others v	Argument

Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and Others [1992 Supp (1) SCC 5 1991 Indlaw SC 972	Argument
Prashant G.Desai,learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no.1,on the other hand,would submit	Argument
i	Argument
Public notices having been issued in terms of the Rule 26 of the Rules,an objection which would nullify the Scheme cannot be entertained at this stage	Argument
ii) Respondent No.1 Corporation merely being interested in the implementation of the Scheme is entitled to obtain vacant possession from him so as to enable it to deliver it to the respondent No.3 in whose favour plot No.165 has been finally allotted	Argument
The Scheme in terms of Sub-s.(3) of S.65 of the Act having become a part of the Act,validity thereof cannot be questioned at this stage as modification of the Scheme,if any,will have to undergo the entire process once over again which is not contemplated under the Act	Argument
the Act was enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to the making and execution of development plans and town planning schemes in the State of Gujarat	Ratio of the decision

i) after giving notice in the prescribed manner and in the prescribed form to the persons affected by the scheme,define and demarcate the areas allotted to,or reserved for,any public purpose,or for a purpose of the appropriate authority and the final plots; (ii) after giving notice as aforesaid,determine in a case in which a final plot is to be allotted to persons in ownership in common,the shares of such persons	Statute
Further,Sub-s.(3) of Section 65,Ss.67 and 68 of the Act read as under: "65 -Power of Government to sanction or refuse to sanction the scheme and effect of sanction	Statute

Rules 26(1),26(3) and 33 of the Rules read as under: "26.Procedure to be followed by Town Planning Officer u/s.51 and under sub-s.(1) of s.52 - (1	Statute
For the purpose of preparing the preliminary scheme and final scheme the Town Planning Officer shall give notice in Form H of the date on which he will commence his duties and shall state the time,as provided in Rule 37 within which the owner of any property or right which is injuriously affected by the making of a Town Planning Scheme shall be entitled u/s.82 to make a claim before him	Statute

Before embarking upon the rival contentions,we may also notice that the provisions of the Bombay Town Planning Rules,1955	Ratio of the decision
for short "the Bombay Rules") are in pari materia with 'the Rules	Ratio of the decision
Rule 21 of the Bombay Rules provides for the Procedure to be followed by the Town Planning Officer	Statute
It makes it obligatory on the part of the officer to give notice of the date on which he will commence his duties and shall state therein the time,within which the owner of any property or rights which is injuriously affected by the making of the town planning scheme shall be advertised in one or more newspapers published in the regional language and circulating within the jurisdiction of the local authority and shall be posted in prominent places at or near the area comprised in the scheme and at the office of the Town Planning Officer	Statute
Sub-Rule (3) of Rule 21 of the Bombay Rules provides for serving of a Special notice of at least three clear days' upon the person interested in any plot or in any particular area comprised in the scheme,before the Town Planning Officer proceeds to deal in detail with the portion of the scheme relating thereto	Statute
Sub-Rule (4) makes it imperative upon the Town Planning Officer to "give all persons affected by any particular of the scheme sufficient opportunity of stating their views and shall not give any decision till he has duly considered their representations,if any".Sub-Rule (5) provides for recording a brief minute setting out the points at issue and the necessary particulars if during the proceedings,it appears to the Town Planning Officer that there are conflicting claims or any difference of opinion with regard to any part of the scheme	Statute
Rules 26 of the Rules do not contemplate service of individual notice	Statute
It prescribes service of notice in Form H.A copy of the notice in the said Form is kept at the office of the Town Planning Officer during office hours	Statute
Any person affected by the proposal of the Town Planning Scheme is entitled to inspect the Scheme in the office where arrangements for explaining the scheme proposals are made	Statute
It furthermore provides that any person entitled to claim damages in terms of S.82 of the Act should communicate the details of his claim to the Town Planning Officer	Statute
S.81 of the Act enables the State to transfer of right from original to final plot or extinction of such right	Statute
A Town Planning Scheme,therefore,envisages calling for objection from the persons concerned for three purposes: "(i) in regard to draft scheme; (ii) lodging of any claim for payment of compensation; (iii) participation in the matter of allotment of final plots	Ratio of the decision
We may,however,notice that Rule 21 of the Bombay Rules provides for notice under Sub-rule (3) thereof and a reasonable opportunity of hearing under Sub-Rule (5) thereof	Ratio of the decision
Sub-rule (3) of Rule 21 of the Bombay Rules provides for issuance of a special notice upon the person interested in any plot or in any particular plot comprised in the Scheme	Ratio of the decision
We may also take notice of the decision of this Court in Mansukhlal Jadavji	Ratio of the decision
Darji1991 Indlaw SC 975 (supra) wherein this Court opined that Sub-rule (3) of Rule 21 of the Bombay Rules was mandatory in nature,subject,of course,to the condition that on the crucial date,viz.,when the Town Planning Scheme is notified in the official gazette,he,whether an owner or tenant or sub-tenant,must be in possession of the property	Ratio of the decision
In Jaswantsingh Mathurasingh1991 Indlaw SC 972 (supra),it was reiterated that a tenant or a sub-tenant is a person interested and is entitled to notice	Precedent
In that context,it was held: "The question is whether the tenant or a sub-tenant is a person interested and is entitled to notice	Precedent
It is obvious that u/s.105 of Transfer of Property Act,a lease creates right or an interest in enjoyment of the demised property and a tenant or a sub-tenant is entitled to remain in possession of the demised property until the lease is duly terminated and eviction takes place in accordance with law	Precedent
Therefore,a tenant or a sub-tenant in possession of a tenement in the Town Planning Scheme is a person interested within the meaning of Rules 21(3) and (4) of the Rules	Precedent
But he must be in possession of the property on the crucial date i.e.when	Precedent
the Town Planning Scheme is notified in the official Gazette	Precedent
Every owner or tenant or a sub-tenant,in possession on that date alone shall be entitled to a notice and opportunity	Precedent
Rule 21(3),however,of the Bombay Rules has been amended in tune with Rule 26 of the Rules	Statute
Amended rules are in pari materia with Rule 26 of the Rules	Statute
Appellant was a tenant in respect of plot No.17/8.Plot No.17/7 was not a plot contiguous thereto	Facts
They were separated not only by a road but also by various other plots	Facts
It is also not in dispute that the appellant filed an objection in regard to the draft scheme but did not eventually pursue the same	Ratio of the decision
The draft scheme was approved.867 sq.m.of land had been acquired for public purpose out of the said plot No.17/8.While the proceedings relating to allotment of final plot were in progress,he even did not file any objection thereto	Ratio of the decision
If he intended to claim any interest in a portion of plot No.17/8 either for the purpose of obtaining compensation for acquisition of a part of the land or to continue to have possession over 200 sq.m.of land in plot No.17/8,it was obligatory on his part to take part in the proceedings	Ratio of the decision
Whether irrespective of Rule 26 of the Rules which prescribes for issuance of a general public notice,any special notice upon the appellant was required to be served by the State or by the authority,in our opinion,cannot be gone into by us in these proceedings for the first time	Ratio of the decision
Validity of Rule 26 of the Rules had never been questioned	Ratio of the decision
It had also not been contended that the said Rule is ultra vires S.52 of the Act	Ratio of the decision
A person interested in continuing to keep possession over a property and/ or a part of the amount of compensation must lay his claim before the appropriate authority at the appropriate stage	Ratio of the decision
If in absence of any such claim filed by the appellant,the authorities have proceeded to finalise allotment of final plot in favour of the respondent Nos.3 and 4 herein,it is too late in the day to contend that the entire scheme should be re-opened	Ratio of the decision
We would consider the effect of Sub-s.(3) of S.65 of the Act a little later,but,we may at this juncture notice that the respondent No.3 in whose favour plot No.165 has been allotted which includes 200 sq.m.of land purported to be in possession of the appellant had nothing to do with the dispute between the appellant and his landlord the respondent no.4.Respondent No.4 was in possession of a contiguous plot	Ratio of the decision
Respondent No.4 was owner of both plot	Ratio of the decision
Nos.17/7 and 17/8.He was,therefore,in his own right entitled to final allotment of some plot	Ratio of the decision
We would,however,assume that it was obligatory on the part of the State to serve a special notice upon the appellant	Ratio of the decision
The question,however,would be : what would be the consequence of non-compliance thereof vis-'-vis the conduct of the appellant himself	Ratio of the decision
A person may waive a right either expressly or by necessary implication	Ratio of the decision
He may in a given case disentitle himself from obtaining an equitable relief particularly when he allows a thing to come to an irreversible situation	Ratio of the decision
Different statutes provide for different manner of service of notice	Ratio of the decision
The Bangalore Development Authority Act,1976 provides that every person whose name appears in the assessment list or land revenue records shall be served with notice.[See Sureshchandra C.Mehta v	Ratio of the decision
State of Karnataka and Others 1994 Supp (2) SCC 511 1993 Indlaw SC 538	Ratio of the decision
In West Bengal Housing Board etc.v	Ratio of the decision
Brijendra Prasad Gupta and Others,etc.[AIR 1997 SC 2745],it was opined that the authority is not required to make a roaming enquiry as to who is the person entitled to notice	Ratio of the decision
We have referred to the said decisions only to show that the requirements in regard to the manner of service of notice varies from statute to statute and there exists a difference between the Bombay Rules and the Rules	Ratio of the decision
We are,however,not unmindful of the fact that a statute of town planning ex facie is not a statute for acquisition of a property	Ratio of the decision
An owner of a plot is asked to part therewith only for providing for better facilities of which he would also be a beneficiary	Ratio of the decision
Every step taken by the State does not involve application of the doctrine of eminent domain	Ratio of the decision
In this case,the appellant did not oppose the draft scheme	Ratio of the decision
It accepted that the State had a right to do so	Ratio of the decision
Existence of a public purpose and increase in the valuation of the property was admitted	Ratio of the decision
There exists a distinction in the Action of the planning authority as regards vesting of a property in it and one so as to enable it to create a third party interest vis-'-vis for the purpose of re-allotment thereof	Ratio of the decision
In the former case,the vesting of the land may be held to be an act of acquisition,whereas in the latter,it would be distribution of certain benefits having regard to the purpose sought to be achieved by a statute involving town planning	Ratio of the decision
It was on that legal principle,this Court in State of Gujarat v	Ratio of the decision
Shantilal Mangaldas & Ors.[1969 (3) SCR 341 1969 Indlaw SC	Ratio of the decision
254],opined that when a development is made,the owner of the property gets much more than what would have he got,if the same remained undeveloped in the process as by reason thereof he gets the benefit of living in a developed town having good town planning	Ratio of the decision
S.67 of the Act provides that all lands required by the appropriate authority shall,unless it is otherwise determined in such scheme,vest absolutely in the appropriate authority free from all encumbrances with effect from the date on which the preliminary scheme comes into force	Statute
What would be the quantum of payment of compensation therefor is also provided in S.82 of the Act	Statute
It is in the aforementioned situation,a claim is to be made before the authority whenever a notice in Form H is published	Statute
If a claim is not filed,the person,who is said to be injuriously affected,does so at its own peril	Statute
Had such a claim been filed,the authority before making final allotment could have considered the competing claims wherefor a large number of factors were required to be taken into consideration,viz.,the location of the land,the area of the land,the nature of right,etc	Statute
When a statute makes an elaborate provision as regards the formalities required to be undergone at every stage by the local authority,the State Government and other authorities concerned in preparing and making the final Town Planning Scheme,the same should be considered to be exhaustively.[Maneklal Chhotalal	Ratio of the decision

Indlaw SC 138 (supra),it was held: "Therefore,having due regard to the substantive and procedural aspects,we are satisfied that the Act imposes only reasonable restrictions,in which case,it is saved u/art.19(5) of the Constitution	Precedent
The considerations referred to above will also show that the grievance of the petitioners that Art.14 is violated,is also not acceptable	Precedent
See also Bhikhubhai Vithlabhai Patel & Ors.v	Precedent
State of Gujarat & Anr.2008 (4) SCALE 278 2008 Indlaw SC 527	Precedent
We are,however,not oblivious that in a given situation,a question may also arise as to whether the restrictions imposed by a statute are reasonable or not	Ratio of the decision
It is not a case where the State by its acts of omissions and commissions was unjustly enriching itself	Ratio of the decision
It was a dispute between two private parties as regards the right to obtain final allotment; the principles underlying the same are not in dispute	Ratio of the decision
What is in dispute is the distribution of quantum thereof between two competing claimants,viz.,landlord and tenant	Ratio of the decision
We do not mean to say that under no circumstances the appellant was entitled to allotment of a portion of the property or mandatory compensation in lieu thereof from the landlord	Ratio of the decision
But,we intend to emphasise that he has lost his right to enforce the same in a public law forum	Ratio of the decision
He has no enforceable claim against the State at this juncture	Ratio of the decision
He may pursue his claim only against the respondent No.4 in an appropriate proceedings wherein for certain purposes the State or the authorities may also be impleaded as a party	Ratio of the decision
Even if he had a claim he would be deemed to have waived the same for the reasons stated hereinafter	Ratio of the decision
It is not in dispute that: "(a) Appellant although filed an objection with regard to the draft scheme,did not choose to pursue it	Ratio of the decision
b	Ratio of the decision
He did not file objections for re-allotment and did not participate in the proceedings following acquisition instituted by the authorities under the Act	Ratio of the decision
In view of the above,the issue is whether it was open to him to assert his purported right to special notice in respect of the final allotment in the instant case given the fact that he did not pursue his objections to the draft scheme and subsequently did not object/participate during the proceedings for re-allotment	Ratio of the decision
It has been noticed by us hereinbefore that under Rule 26 of the Rules applicable in the instant case,as distinguished from the Bombay Rules (wherein special notice is required),no special notice is mandatorily required to be served	Ratio of the decision
Assuming,however,that it was obligatory for the State to issue notice to the appellant,the question is whether the principle of waiver precludes him from claiming equitable relief in this case due to his earlier conduct which allowed the entire process of acquisition and allotment to become final	Ratio of the decision
We are of the opinion that even if he had any such right,he waived the same	Ratio of the decision
In Halsbury's Laws of England,Volume 16(2),4th edition,para 907,it is stated: "The expression 'waiver' may,in law,bear different meanings	Ratio of the decision
The primary meaning has been said to be the abandonment of a right in such a way that the other party is entitled to plead the abandonment by way of confession and avoidance if the right is thereafter asserted,and is either express or implied from conduct	Ratio of the decision
It may arise from a party making an election,for example whether or not to exercise a contractual right	Ratio of the decision
Waiver may also be by virtue of equitable or promissory estoppel; unlike waiver arising from an election,no question arises of any particular knowledge on the part of the person making the representation,and the estoppel may be suspensory only	Ratio of the decision
Where the waiver is not express,it may be implied from conduct which is inconsistent with the continuance of the right,without the need for writing or for consideration moving from,or detriment to,the party who benefits by the waiver,but mere acts of indulgence will not amount to waiver; nor may a party benefit from the waiver unless he has altered his position in reliance on it	Ratio of the decision
As early as 1957,the concept of waiver was articulated in a case involving the late assertion of a claim regarding improper constitution of a Tribunal in Manak Lal v	Precedent
Dr	Precedent
Prem Chand [AIR 1957 SC 425 1957 Indlaw SC 159] in the following terms	Precedent
It is true that waiver cannot always and in every case be inferred merely from the failure of the party to take the objection	Precedent
Waiver can be inferred only if and after it is shown that the party knew about the relevant facts and was aware of his right to take the objection	Precedent
As Sir Johan Romilly M.R.has observed in Vyvyan v	Precedent
Vyvyan	Precedent
1861] 30 Beav.65 : 54 E.R.813,817] "waiver or acquiescence,like election,presupposes that the person to be bound is fully cognizant of his rights,and,that being so,he neglects to enforce them,or chooses one benefit instead of another,either,but not both,of which he might claim	Precedent
In The Director of Inspection of Income Tax (Investigation),New Delhi and Another v	Precedent
Pooran Mal & Sons and Another [(1975) 4 SCC 568 1974 Indlaw SC 354] the issue was regarding waiver of benefits under a statute of limitation	Precedent
It was stated: "We may in this connection refer to the decision in Wilson v	Precedent
McIntosh	Precedent
In that case an applicant to bring lands under the Real Property Act filed his case in court under Section 21,more than three months after a caveat had been lodged,and thereafter obtained an order that the caveator should file her case,which she accordingly did	Precedent
It was held that he had thereby waived his right to have the caveat set aside as lapsed u/s.23.The Privy Council held that the limitation of time contained in S.23 was introduced for the benefit of the applicant,to enable him to obtain a speedy determination of his right to have the land brought under the provisions of the Act and that it was competent for the applicant to waive the limit of the three months,and that he did waive it by stating a case and applying for and obtaining an order upon the appellant to state her case both,which steps assumed and proceeded on the assumption of the continued existence of the caveat	Precedent
They referred with approval to the decision in Phillips v	Precedent
Martin where the Chief Justice said: "Here there is abundant evidence of waiver,and it is quite clear that a man may by his conduct waive a provision of an Act of Parliament intended for his benefit	Precedent
The caveator was not brought into Court in any way until the caveat had lapsed	Precedent
And now the applicant,after all these proceedings have been taken by him,after doubtless much expense has been incurred on the part of the caveator,and after lying by and hoping to get a judgment of the Court in his favour,asks the Court to do that which but for some reasons known to himself he might have asked the Court to do before any other step in the proceedings had been taken	Precedent
I think he is altogether too late	Precedent
It is to my mind a clear principle of equity,and I have no doubt there are abundant authorities on the point,that equity will interfere to prevent the machinery of an Act of Parliament being used by a person to defeat equities which he has himself raised,and to get rid of a waiver created by his own acts	Precedent
The legal principle emerging from these decisions is also stated in Craies on Statute Law (6th Edn.) at page 369 as follows: "As a general rule,the conditions imposed by statutes which authorise legal proceedings are treated as being indispensable to giving the court jurisdiction	Ratio of the decision
But if it appears that the statutory conditions were inserted by the legislature simply for the security or benefit of the parties to the Action themselves,and that no public interests are involved,such conditions will not be considered as indispensable,and either party may waive them without affecting the jurisdiction of the court	Ratio of the decision
emphasis supplied	Ratio of the decision
Applying the above principles to the present case,it must be held that the benefit of notice provided under the Act and Rules being for the benefit of the Appellant in which no public interests are involved,he has waived the same	Ratio of the decision
Significantly,a similar conclusion was reached in the case of Krishna Bahadur v	Precedent
Purna Theatre [(2004) 8 SCC 229 2004	Precedent
Indlaw SC 681],though the principle was stated far more precisely,in the following terms: "The principle of waiver although is akin to the principle of estoppel; the difference between the two,however,is that whereas estoppel is not a cause of action; it is a rule of evidence; waiver is contractual and may constitute a cause of action; it is an agreement between the parties and a party fully knowing of its rights has agreed not to assert a right for a consideration	Precedent
A right can be waived by the party for whose benefit certain requirements or conditions had been provided for by a statute subject to the condition that no public interest is involved therein	Precedent
Whenever waiver is pleaded it is for the party pleading the same to show that an agreement waiving the right in consideration of some compromise came into being	Precedent
Statutory right,however,may also be waived by his conduct	Precedent

Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel and Ors.[2006 (8) SCALE 631 2006 Indlaw SC 786],this Court observed: "The matter may be considered from another angle	Precedent
If the first respondent has expressly waived his right on the trade mark registered in the name of the appellant-Company,could he claim the said right indirectly	Precedent
The answer to the said question must be rendered in the negative	Precedent
It is well-settled that what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly	Precedent
The term 'Waiver' has been described in the following words: "Waiver is the abandonment of a right in such a way that the other party is entitled to plead the abandonment by way of confession and avoidance if the right is thereafter asserted,and is either express or implied from conduct	Precedent
A person who is entitled to rely on a stipulation,existing for his benefit alone,in a contract or of a statutory provision may waive it,and allow the contract or transaction to proceed as though the stipulation or provision did not exist	Precedent
Waiver of this kind depends upon consent,and the fact that the other party has acted upon it is sufficient consideration It seems that,in general,where one party has,by his words or conduct,made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly,then,once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it,so as to alter his position,the party who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal relationship as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him,but he must accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he has himself so introduced,even though it is not supported in point of law by any consideration.[See 16 Halsbury's Laws (4th edn) para 1471	Precedent
In this view of the matter,it may safely be stated that the appellant,through his conduct,has waived his right to an equitable remedy in the instant case	Ratio of the decision
Such conduct precludes and operates as estoppel against him with respect to asserting a right over a portion of the acquired land in a situation where the scheme in question has attained finality following as a result of the appellant's inaction	Ratio of the decision
Lalit submits that his client is ready and willing to pay some reasonable amount to the respondent No.3 in whose favour plot No.165 has been finally allotted	Ratio of the decision
Issuance of any such direction,in our opinion,is legally impermissible	Ratio of the decision
We,therefore,are of the opinion that in this case,no relief can be granted to the appellant	Ruling by Present Court
He may,however,take recourse to such remedy which is available with him in law including one by filing a suit or making a representation before the State	Ruling by Present Court
For the reasons aforementioned,the appeal is dismissed	Ruling by Present Court
