April,2003 in C.A.Nos.7123-7124 of 2003 held that this Court is satisfied that no fault can be found with the impugned judgment of the High Court so far as the setting aside of the sale is concerned,we dismiss the appeals,so far it relates to cancellation of auction sale	Ruling by Present Court
We have heard the parties only on the limited question as to why the amount which has been directed to be refunded to the auction purchasers-appellants herein should not bear reasonable interest	Ratio of the decision
In a situation like in the present case,one cannot hold of any statute entitling the auction purchasers to claim interest,in case the auction got cancelled or set aside by the Court of law	Ratio of the decision
Counsel for the parties also could not refer any of the clauses of auction prescribing interest on refund of amount in case of cancellation of auction or sale	Ratio of the decision
The question arises as to whether in such a situation an auction purchaser can claim interest on equitable ground	Ratio of the decision
In State of Maharashtra and others vs	Precedent
Maimuma Banu and others,(2003) 7 SCC 448 2003 Indlaw SC 625,the question arose as to whether interest was payable on rental compensation	Precedent
In the said case,Government resolution provided for payment of rental compensation expeditiously but no provision was made to pay interest in case of delayed payment	Precedent
This Court in the said case held: "10.The crucial question is whether there can be any direction for interest on rental compensation once it is held that the same has to be paid within the time frame,notwithstanding the fact that there is no statutory obligation	Precedent
11.It is not in dispute that in certain cases payments have already been made	Precedent
Though the inevitable conclusion is that the High Court is not justified in directing grant of interest on the logic of various provisions contained in the Act,yet there is an element of equity in favour of the landowners	Precedent
It is,however,seen that the writ applications were filed long after the possession was taken	Precedent
This factor cannot be lost sight of while working out the equities	Precedent
It would,therefore,be appropriate if the appellants pay interest	Precedent
6% from 1-4-2000 till amounts payable as rental compensation are paid to the landowners concerned	Precedent
This direction shall not apply to those cases where the payments have already been made prior to 1-4-2000.Appeals are allowed to the extent indicated without any stipulation of costs	Precedent
In the present case,we find that there was no mis-representation on the part of the auction purchasers; they deposited the total auction amount within the time stipulated	Ratio of the decision
It has not been in dispute that the title of the land was also transferred in their favour	Ratio of the decision
But for the reasons mentioned by the High Court the sale has been cancelled	Ratio of the decision
It has been ordered to refund amount in favour of the auction purchaser	Ratio of the decision
appellant(s).We find no reason as to why on equitable grounds the appellants should not get interest on the said amount	Ratio of the decision
Taking into consideration the aforesaid factor while working out equities,it would,therefore,be appropriate to direct the State to pay interest at the rate of 6% on the amount to be refunded as per the High Court's order with effect from 27th April,2001 and 3rd	Ratio of the decision
September,2001,the day,the High Court passed the impugned order	Ratio of the decision
