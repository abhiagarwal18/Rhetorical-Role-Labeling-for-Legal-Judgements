d5_s1	The appellant who was arraigned as Accused 2 was tried along with five other accused for offences punishable under Sections 498A and 302 read with Ss. 149 and 201 of the IPC by the 1st Additional Sessions Judge, Madhepura. 
d5_s2	The allegations against the accused, inter alia, were that they subjected one Bindula Devi to cruelty and harassment with a view to coercing her and her other relatives to meet their unlawful demand of property and that on her failure to fulfill their unlawful demand, in furtherance of their common object, they committed her murder and that they caused disappearance of her dead body with an intention to screen themselves from legal punishment. 
d5_s3	Bindula Devi was married to Accused 1 Jaipraksh Yadav. 
d5_s4	The appellant and Accused 3 Shakun Devo Yadav are the brothers of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav. 
d5_s5	Accused 4 Dani Dutta Yadav is their father and Accused 5 Satya Bhama Devi is their mother. 
d5_s6	Accused 6 Fudai Yadav is brother-in-law of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav. 
d5_s7	The prosecution story is reflected in the evidence of Complainant PW- 9 Debu Yadav, the father of Bindula Devi. 
d5_s8	He stated that his daughter Bindula Devi was married to Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav. 
d5_s9	He further stated that in the marriage one buffalo, one cow and one bullock were given as dowry to the accused as per their demand. 
d5_s10	However, the accused were not satisfied with that. 
d5_s11	They demanded a wrist watch and a cycle which were given to them. 
d5_s12	Even then they continued to harass and assault Bindula Devi. 
d5_s13	She gave birth to a male child. 
d5_s14	The accused kept Bindula Devi in their house and sent the child to his house so that he would rear the child. 
d5_s15	PW- 9 Debu Yadav further stated that when in Ashwin month he brought Bindula Devi to his house she told him about the ill-treatment meted out to her at her matrimonial home. 
d5_s16	She did not want to go back. 
d5_s17	He tried to pacify her. 
d5_s18	He transferred two kathas of land in her name. 
d5_s19	She then went to her matrimonial home. 
d5_s20	The accused insisted that she should sell the land. 
d5_s21	As she did not agree to selling of the land, they subjected her to further torture. 
d5_s22	PW-9 Debu Yadav further stated that on a Monday at about 4.00 p.m. Accused 6 Fudai Yadav came to his house and enquired whether Bindula Devi had come there and told him that she had run away from the house. 
d5_s23	He told Accused 6 Fudai Yadav that Bindula Devi would not run away from her house. 
d5_s24	He then proceeded to the house of the accused situated in village Kolhua along with his son Sachindra Yadav and his brother-in-law. 
d5_s25	Accused 6 Fudai Yadav accompanied them for some distance and then left for some other place. 
d5_s26	They reached Kolhua village and found the house of the accused to be empty. 
d5_s27	All the accused had left the house with their belongings. 
d5_s28	Bindula Devi was also not present. 
d5_s29	On enquiry the neighbours told him that because Bindula Devi had refused to transfer the land in the accused's name they had administered poison to her and murdered her. 
d5_s30	He met Sub-Inspector of Police by the river side who recorded his statement. 
d5_s31	A search was conducted. 
d5_s32	The dead body of Bindula Devi was recovered from the river bed. 
d5_s33	Formal FIR of PW-9 Debu Yadav was registered on 31/1/1989 and the investigation was started. 
d5_s34	The appellant, Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav and Accused 3 Shakun Devo Yadav surrendered before the court on 6/3/1989. 
d5_s35	Accused 4 Dani Dutta Yadav surrendered before the court on 26/8/1989. 
d5_s36	At the trial, though, the prosecution examined 13 witnesses, it's case rested on the evidence of PW-9 Debu Yadav, father of the deceased and PW-10 Sachindra Yadav, brother of the deceased. 
d5_s37	PWs-2 to 7 turned hostile. 
d5_s38	The accused pleaded not guilty to the charge. 
d5_s39	They contended that when Bindula Devi went to take bath, she slipped in the water, got drowned and died. 
d5_s40	The trial court convicted the accused section 302 read with section 149 of the IPC and sentenced each of them to suffer life imprisonment. 
d5_s41	They were also convicted under Section 498A of the IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years each. 
d5_s42	They were further convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years each section 201 of the IPC. 
d5_s43	All the substantive sentences were ordered to run concurrently. 
d5_s44	The High Court dismissed their appeal. 
d5_s45	Hence, this appeal, by special leave, by Accused 2. 
d5_s46	Mr. Gaurav Agrawal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the instant case rests on circumstantial evidence. 
d5_s47	Counsel pointed out that the appellant is the brother of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav, the husband of Bindula Devi. 
d5_s48	PW-10 Sachindra Yadav stated in his evidence that Accused 1 had separated from his other brothers. 
d5_s49	There is no evidence on record to establish that the appellant was party to any dowry demand or to any ill-treatment meted out to Bindula Devi. 
d5_s50	Counsel submitted that in cases where apart from husband other members of his family are charged with offences under Sections 304B, 302 and 498A of the IPC and the case rests on circumstantial evidence, unless the circumstantial evidence is of required standard conviction cannot be based on it. 
d5_s51	In this connection he relied on Vithal Tukaram More & Ors. 
d5_s52	v. State of Maharashtra, (2002) 7 SCC 20 2002 Indlaw SC 1622. 
d5_s53	Counsel submitted that allegations about motive are vague. 
d5_s54	Medical evidence is inconclusive. 
d5_s55	The prosecution has, therefore, failed to establish its case. 
d5_s56	In any case, since the appellant was residing separately, in the absence of any clinching evidence establishing his complicity he cannot be convicted. 
d5_s57	Mr. Gopal Singh, learned counsel for the State of Bihar on the other hand submitted that the evidence on record establishes that all the accused were staying in houses situated in the same courtyard. 
d5_s58	Counsel submitted that evidence of PW-9 Debu Yadav and PW-10 Sachindra Yadav establishes the prosecution case. 
d5_s59	Pertinently, the accused did not lodge any complaint to the police. 
d5_s60	The fact that they left the house with all their belongings suggests their complicity. 
d5_s61	Counsel submitted that Bindula Devi disappeared from the house of the accused. 
d5_s62	As to how she died in suspicious circumstances was within the knowledge of the accused. 
d5_s63	The burden was shifted to the accused which they have not discharged. 
d5_s64	Adverse inference must be drawn against the accused. 
d5_s65	In this connection, counsel relied on Balaram Prasad Agrawal v. State of Bihar & Ors, (1997) 9 SCC 338 1996 Indlaw SC 1761. 
d5_s66	Counsel submitted that appeal be, therefore, dismissed. 
d5_s67	We have already referred to the evidence of father of Bindula Devi PW- 9 Debu Yadav. 
d5_s68	He has given a graphic account of the harassment and ill- treatment meted out to the deceased by the accused. 
d5_s69	They were not happy with a bullock, a cow and a buffalo which were given as dowry. 
d5_s70	They asked for a watch and a cycle. 
d5_s71	That was also given. 
d5_s72	They asked for more. 
d5_s73	PW-9 Debu Yadav transferred 2 kathas of land to Bindula Devi. 
d5_s74	The accused wanted to sell it or wanted it to be transferred in their names and since Bindula Devi did not agree to that they continued to torture her. 
d5_s75	Her son was sent to her father so that he would be brought up by him, but she was kept in the matrimonial house obviously to work. 
d5_s76	PW-10 Sachindra Yadav the brother of Bindula Devi has corroborated his father. 
d5_s77	It is distressing to note that all the other witnesses, that is PW-2 to PW-7 turned hostile. 
d5_s78	In the facts of this case, it is indeed a pointer to the guilt of the accused. 
d5_s79	They won over the prosecution witnesses. 
d5_s80	We note with some anguish the following sentences uttered by PW-9 Debu Yadav in his cross-examination probably as an answer to the usual question about there being no independent witness to depose about cruelty. 
d5_s81	He stated "whenever my daughter visited my house, she used to complain that she is being tortured and assaulted there. 
d5_s82	Who else can be a witness to this fact?" Having perused the evidence of PWs-9 and 10 we have no manner of doubt that Bindula Devi was subjected to cruelty and harassment for dowry by the accused. 
d5_s83	Evidence of these witnesses is straightforward and honest. 
d5_s84	There is no exaggeration. 
d5_s85	In the cross-examination their evidence has not suffered any dent. 
d5_s86	Implicit reliance can be placed on them. 
d5_s87	It is submitted that the appellant had separated from Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav and, hence, he cannot be a party to the alleged acts of cruelty of the other accused. 
d5_s88	We find no substance in this submission. 
d5_s89	Though, PW-10 Sachindra Yadav stated that Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav had separated from his brothers after marriage, he has clarified that all the brothers have their houses in a common courtyard. 
d5_s90	PW-9 Debu Yadav has specifically named the appellant as a person who demanded cattle. 
d5_s91	He has stated that the accused were not satisfied with the cattle given by him. 
d5_s92	They demanded more dowry. 
d5_s93	They used to harass and assault Bindula Devi. 
d5_s94	He stated that when he went to the house of the accused after receiving information that she had left their house, he found the house to be empty. 
d5_s95	All the accused had absconded. 
d5_s96	They had taken their belongings with them. 
d5_s97	This is confirmed by PW-13 Surendra Rai the Investigating Officer. 
d5_s98	He stated that when he went to the house of the accused after receiving information about disappearance of Bindula Devi he found the house completely empty. 
d5_s99	Even the household articles and food grains were missing. 
d5_s100	The accused were not present. 
d5_s101	No member of their family was present. 
d5_s102	Bindula Devi was also not present. 
d5_s103	These circumstances persuade us to reject the submission that the appellant did not join the other accused in treating Bindula Devi with cruelty. 
d5_s104	The conviction and sentence of the appellant under Section 498A of the IPC is therefore perfectly justified. 
d5_s105	We now come to the death of Bindula Devi. 
d5_s106	PW-9 Debu Yadav and PW-10 Schindra Yadav stated that dead body of Bindula Devi was recovered from the river bed. 
d5_s107	The Investigating Officer PW-13 Surendra Rai stated that after recording the FIR of PW-9 Debu Yadav, he inspected the house of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav. 
d5_s108	The dead body of Bindula Devi was found lying 600 yards away from the house of the accused. 
d5_s109	It was lying in one foot deep water, close to the southern bank of the river, near a ferry. 
d5_s110	The ferry was situated adjacent to the maize field of Hazari Mandal. 
d5_s111	He took it out and prepared inquest report. 
d5_s112	He further stated that one Vinod stated that on 29/1/1989, the accused had a meeting. 
d5_s113	On 30/1/1989, they left for some other place and in the evening it was revealed that they had killed Bindula Devi by poisoning her and had thrown her dead body at the ferry. 
d5_s114	The Investigating Officer further stated that Vinod, Parmeshvari Yadav, Brij Bihari Yadav also confirmed this fact. 
d5_s115	All these persons turned hostile in the court. 
d5_s116	PW-12 Dr. Arun Kumar Mandal did the post-mortem on the dead body of Bindula Devi. 
d5_s117	Following are his observations: 
d5_s118	(1) Epistaxis from both nostrils. 
d5_s119	(2) Blood mixed with froth from mouth. 
d5_s120	(3) Both eye balls congested, cornea hazy. 
d5_s121	(4) Face congested and cyanosed. 
d5_s122	(5) Skin of both hands and feet were corrugated. 
d5_s123	On opening of skull all the blood vessels were congested in the maninges and brain matter. 
d5_s124	In the chest both the lungs were found congested, frothy and spongy and on cutting blood stains froth found in segments. 
d5_s125	In the heart both chambers were found full. 
d5_s126	In the stomach semi-digested food about 4 ounces with blood mixed. 
d5_s127	In the small intestine-gas and solid facees. 
d5_s128	In the large intestine-gas and solid facees. 
d5_s129	In the case of kidneys both were found congested. 
d5_s130	Liver an spleen were also found congested. 
d5_s131	Uterus contained about full term dead male baby." 
d5_s132	PW-12 Dr. Arun Kumar Mandal opined that the cause of death was asphaxia due to drowning. 
d5_s133	He stated that in cases of drowning, if immediate death is caused, then, there will be negligible quantum of water in the stomach. 
d5_s134	He further stated that death may be caused even in one foot deep water if the victim is kept in water with his neck pressed in sleeping position. 
d5_s135	It may be stated here that report of the viscera examination is not on record. 
d5_s136	Dr. Mandal has admitted that he did not know the result of viscera examination. 
d5_s137	He added that there were no injuries on the person of the deceased. 
d5_s138	In our opinion, the evidence of the father and the brother of Bindula Devi and other attendant circumstances such as strong motive; the fact that the accused did not lodge any complaint about missing of Bindula Devi; that Accused 6 Fudai Yadav went to the house of PW-9 Debu Yadav to enquire about Bindula Devi and then suddenly deserted PWs 9 and 10 when they were going to the house of the accused, that all the accused absconded from their house with their belongings and that the house was completely empty, lead to an irresistible conclusion that the accused were responsible for the death of Bindula Devi. 
d5_s139	It is submitted that since there were no injuries on the dead body of Bindula Devi, it would be wrong to conclude that Bindula Devi was kept in water in a sleeping position with her neck pressed as suggested by the doctor. 
d5_s140	The prosecution story that the accused caused her death must therefore be rejected. 
d5_s141	Medical evidence, it is argued, does not support the prosecution case. 
d5_s142	In our opinion, the prosecution having established that the accused treated the deceased with cruelty and that they subjected her to harassment for dowry, the accused ought to have disclosed the facts which were in their personal and special knowledge to disprove the prosecution case that they murdered Bindula Devi. 
d5_s143	section 106 of the Evidence Act covers such a situation. 
d5_s144	The burden which had shifted to the accused was not discharged by them. 
d5_s145	In this connection, we may usefully refer to the judgment of this Court in Shambhu Nath Mehra v. State of Ajmer, AIR 1956 SC 404 1956 Indlaw SC 81 where this Court explained how section 101 and section 106 of the Evidence Act operate. 
d5_s146	Relevant portion of the said judgment reads thus: 
d5_s147	"(10) section 106 is an exception to section 101. 
d5_s148	section 101 lays down the general rule about the burden of proof. 
d5_s149	'Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist'. 
d5_s150	Illustration (a) says - 
d5_s151	'A desires a Court to give judgment that B shall be punished for a crime which A says B has committed. 
d5_s152	A must prove that B has committed the crime'. 
d5_s153	(11) This lays down the general rule that in a criminal case, the burden of proof is on the prosecution and section 106 is certainly not intended to relieve it of that duty. 
d5_s154	On the contrary, it is designed to meet certain exceptional cases in which it would be impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult, for the prosecution to establish facts which are 'especially' within the knowledge of the accused and which he could prove without difficulty or inconvenience." 
d5_s155	In Balram Prasad Agrawal v. State of Bihar, (1997) 9 SCC 338 1996 Indlaw SC 1761, the prosecution had established the cruel conduct of the accused i.e. her husband and members of his family and the sufferings undergone by the deceased at their hands. 
d5_s156	The unbearable conduct of the accused ultimately resulted in her death by drowning in the well in the courtyard of the accused's house. 
d5_s157	This Court observed that what happened on the fateful night and what led to the deceased's falling in the well was wholly within the personal and special knowledge of the accused. 
d5_s158	But they kept mum on this aspect. 
d5_s159	This Court observed that it is true that the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. 
d5_s160	But once the prosecution is found to have shown that the accused were guilty of persistent conduct of cruelty qua the deceased spread over years as was well established from the unshaken testimony of father of the deceased, the facts which were in the personal knowledge of the accused who were present in the house on that fateful night could have been revealed by them to disprove the prosecution case. 
d5_s161	This Court observed that the accused had not discharged the burden which had shifted to them under section 106 of the Evidence Act. 
d5_s162	While coming to this conclusion, this Court relied on Shambhu Nath Mehra. 
d5_s163	In the present case, the deceased was admittedly in the custody of the accused. 
d5_s164	She disappeared from their house. 
d5_s165	As to how her dead body was found in the river was within their special and personal knowledge. 
d5_s166	They could have revealed the facts to disprove the prosecution case that they had killed Bindula Devi. 
d5_s167	They failed to discharge the burden which had shifted to them under section 106 of the Evidence Act. 
d5_s168	The prosecution is not expected to give the exact manner in which the deceased was killed. 
d5_s169	Adverse inference needs to be drawn against the accused as they failed to explain how the deceased was found dead in the river in one foot deep water. 
d5_s170	Pertinently, the post-mortem notes do not indicate presence of huge amount of water in the dead body. 
d5_s171	According to PW-12 Dr. Mandal, in a case of drowning, if immediate death is caused, then, there will be negligible quantum of water in the stomach. 
d5_s172	From the evidence of PW-12 Dr. Mandal, it appears that the death of Bindula Devi occurred immediately after she was drowned in the water because there was not much water in her stomach. 
d5_s173	It is also pertinent to note that Bindula Devi was pregnant. 
d5_s174	Her uterus contained full term dead male baby. 
d5_s175	She could not have, therefore, offered any resistance. 
d5_s176	It appears that, therefore, there were no injuries on the dead body. 
d5_s177	The whole operation appears to have been done swiftly and skillfully. 
d5_s178	But in any case, as stated hereinabove, it is not for the prosecution to explain in what manner Bindula Devi was done to death by the accused because Bindula Devi was staying in the house of the accused prior to the occurrence and she disappeared from that house. 
d5_s179	All the circumstances leading to her unnatural death were within the special and personal knowledge of the accused which they chose not to disclose. 
d5_s180	Instead, they gave a totally false explanation that when Bindula Devi had gone for bath, she slipped, got drowned in the water and died. 
d5_s181	This story is palpably false. 
d5_s182	The false explanation offered by the accused further strengthens the prosecution case as it becomes an additional link in the chain of circumstances. 
d5_s183	It is true that in Vithal Tukaram More this Court has held that in a case where other members of the husband's family are charged with offences under Sections 304B, 302 and 498A of the IPC and the case rests on circumstantial evidence, the circumstantial evidence must be of required standard if conviction has to be based on it. 
d5_s184	We are of the considered opinion that the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this case is of required standard. 
d5_s185	No other inference, except that of the guilt of the accused, is possible on the basis of the evidence on record. 
d5_s186	The established facts are consistent only with the hypothesis of their guilt and inconsistent with their innocence. 
d5_s187	The appeal, therefore, deserves to be dismissed. 
d5_s188	Before we part, we must refer to a very vital aspect of this case. 
d5_s189	PW-9 Debu Yadav, the father of Bindula Devi stated that the neighbours told him that Bindula Devi was poisoned by the accused. 
d5_s190	PW-10 Sachindra Yadav, brother of Bindula Devi has also stated so. 
d5_s191	PW-13 Surendra Rai, the Investigating Officer went a step further. 
d5_s192	He stated that Vinod Yadav, Shiv Pujan Ram, Vinod Kumar Mehta, Parmeshwar Yadav and Braj Bihari Yadav told him that the accused had killed Bindula Devi by poisoning her; that they had concealed the dead body in the river and had run away. 
d5_s193	Unfortunately, these witnesses turned hostile. 
d5_s194	But the fact remains that the prosecution had come out with a case of poisoning. 
d5_s195	It was, therefore, necessary for the prosecution to get the viscera examined from Forensic Science Laboratory ("the FSL"). 
d5_s196	The trial court has observed that the Investigating Officer had filed a petition on 19/4/1988 requesting the doctor to send the viscera for chemical analysis to the FSL, Patna. 
d5_s197	Post-mortem notes mention that viscera was protected for future needs. 
d5_s198	This is also stated by PW-12 Dr. Mandal. 
d5_s199	Dr. Mandal has, however, added that he did not know the result of viscera examination. 
d5_s200	From the evidence of the Investigating Officer, PW-13 Surendra Rai, it appears that the doctor did not send the viscera to the FSL. 
d5_s201	When he was questioned about the viscera report, the Investigating Officer stated in the cross-examination that a letter had been sent to the doctor about viscera examination. 
d5_s202	He further stated that he did not make any complaint against the doctor to the senior officers, but, informed his officer through diary. 
d5_s203	We are of the opinion that the doctor ought to have sent the viscera to the FSL when he was requested to do so. 
d5_s204	On his failure to do so, the Investigating Officer should have informed his superior officer and taken steps to ensure that viscera is sent to the FSL rather than just making a diary entry. 
d5_s205	Such a supine indifference has a disastrous effect on the criminal justice administration system. 
d5_s206	We are aware that in some cases where there is other clinching evidence on record to establish the case of poisoning, this Court has proceeded to convict the accused even in the absence of viscera report. 
d5_s207	In Bhupendra v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 2013 (13) SCALE 52 2013 Indlaw SC 736 this Court was concerned with a case where the viscera report was not on record, but, there was enough evidence of poisoning. 
d5_s208	The accused was charged under Sections 304-B and 306 of the IPC. 
d5_s209	Drawing support from the presumptions under Sections 113B and 113A of the Evidence Act, 1872 and, after referring to relevant judgments on the point, this Court held that death of the deceased was caused by poisoning. 
d5_s210	The relevant observation of this Court could be quoted. 
d5_s211	These decisions clearly bring out that a chemical examination of the viscera is not mandatory in every case of a dowry death; even when a viscera report is sought for, its absence is not necessarily fatal to the case of the prosecution when an unnatural death punishable under Section 304-B of the IPC or section 306 of the IPC takes place; in a case of an unnatural death inviting Section 304-B of the IPC (read with the presumption under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act, 1872) or section 306 of the IPC (read with the presumption under Section 113-A of the Evidence Act, 1872) as long as there is evidence of poisoning, identification of the poison may not be absolutely necessary." 
d5_s212	In Chhotan Sao & Another v. State of Bihar, 2013 (15) SCALE 338 2013 Indlaw SC 851 this Court was dealing with a case involving Sections 304-B and 498A of the IPC. 
d5_s213	The allegations were that the deceased was murdered by poisoning her. 
d5_s214	The viscera report was not on record. 
d5_s215	There was no other evidence on record to establish that the deceased was poisoned. 
d5_s216	This Court distinguished the case before it from the facts of Bhupendra and while acquitting the accused of the charge under Section 304-B of the IPC made the following pertinent observations: 
d5_s217	Before parting with the appeal, we wish to place on record our anguish regarding the inadequacy of investigation, the failure to discharge the responsibility on the part of the public prosecutor and the Magistrate who took cognizance of the offence under Section 304-B. The Investigating Officer who submitted the charge sheet ought not to have done it without securing the viscera report from the forensic lab and placing it before the Court. 
d5_s218	Having regard to the nature of the crime, it is a very vital document more particularly in the absence of any direct evidence regarding the consumption of poison by the deceased Babita Devi. 
d5_s219	Equally the public prosecutor failed in his responsibility to guide the investigating officer in that regard. 
d5_s220	Coming to the magistrate who committed the matter to the Sessions Court, he failed to apply his mind and mechanically committed the matter for trial. 
d5_s221	Public prosecutors and judicial officers owe a greater responsibility to ensure compliance with law in a criminal case. 
d5_s222	Any lapse on their part such as the one which occurred in the instant case is bound to jeopardize the prosecution case resulting in avoidable acquittals. 
d5_s223	Inefficiency and callousness on their part is bound to shake the faith of the society in the system of administration of criminal justice in this country which, in our opinion, has reached considerably lower level than desirable." 
d5_s224	We must note that this is the third case which this Court has noticed in a short span of two months where, in a case of suspected poisoning, viscera report is not brought on record. 
d5_s225	We express our extreme displeasure about the way in which such serious cases are dealt with. 
d5_s226	We wonder whether these lapses are the result of inadvertence or they are a calculated move to frustrate the prosecution. 
d5_s227	Though the FSL report is not mandatory in all cases, in cases where poisoning is suspected, it would be advisable and in the interest of justice to ensure that the viscera is sent to the FSL and the FSL report is obtained. 
d5_s228	This is because not in all cases there is adequate strong other evidence on record to prove that the deceased was administered poison by the accused. 
d5_s229	In a criminal trial the Investigating Officer, the Prosecutor and the Court play a very important role. 
d5_s230	The court's prime duty is to find out the truth. 
d5_s231	The Investigating Officer, the Prosecutor and the Courts must work in sync and ensure that the guilty are punished by bringing on record adequate credible legal evidence. 
d5_s232	If the Investigating Officer stumbles, the Prosecutor must pull him up and take necessary steps to rectify the lacunae. 
d5_s233	The Criminal Court must be alert, it must oversee their actions and, in case, it suspects foul play, it must use its vast powers and frustrate any attempt to set at naught a genuine prosecution. 
d5_s234	Perhaps, the instant case would have been further strengthened had the viscera been sent to the FSL and the FSL report was on record. 
d5_s235	These scientific tests are of vital importance to a criminal case, particularly when the witnesses are increasingly showing a tendency to turn hostile. 
d5_s236	In the instant case all those witnesses who spoke about poisoning turned hostile. 
d5_s237	Had the viscera report been on record and the case of poisoning was true, the prosecution would have been on still firmer grounds. 
d5_s238	Having noticed that, in several cases where poisoning is suspected, the prosecuting agencies are not taking steps to obtain viscera report, we feel it necessary to issue certain directions in that behalf. 
d5_s239	We direct that in cases where poisoning is suspected, immediately after the post- mortem, the viscera should be sent to the FSL. 
d5_s240	The prosecuting agencies should ensure that the viscera is, in fact, sent to the FSL for examination and the FSL should ensure that the viscera is examined immediately and report is sent to the investigating agencies/courts post haste. 
d5_s241	If the viscera report is not received, the concerned court must ask for explanation and must summon the concerned officer of the FSL to give an explanation as to why the viscera report is not forwarded to the investigating agency/court. 
d5_s242	The criminal court must ensure that it is brought on record. 
d5_s243	We have examined the merits of the case and held that the appeal deserves to be dismissed. 
d5_s244	In the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed. 
d5_s245	A copy of this order be sent to the Registrar Generals of all the High Courts with a direction to circulate the same to all subordinate Criminal Courts; to the Director of Prosecution, to the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, to the Secretary, Home Department and to the Director, Forensic Science Laboratory within the jurisdiction of the respective High Courts. 
d5_s246	Appeal dismissed
